# LinkedList

- Linear data structure, similar to arrays
- Each element in linked list is a seperate object while all the objects are linked togather by the reference field.
- The idea is to drop the continous memory requirements so that insertions, deletions can effeciently happen at the
  middle also and no need to pre-allocate the space.
- 3 types (Singly LinkedList, Doubly LinkedList, Circular LinkedList)

## Singly LinkedList:

- A singly linked list is a data structure made up of nodes, where:
- Each node contains data (a value)
- Each node also has a pointer (reference) to the next node in the list
- The last node points to null
