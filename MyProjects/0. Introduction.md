## Why are you leaving current Organiation?

- I’ve learned a lot and had a great experience in my current organization.
- I believe the time is right for me to take the next step in my career.
- I’m looking for new challenges that will allow me to take on greater responsibilities and continue growing both
  professionally and personally.
- I need a change of environment that can challenge and motivate me to develop new skill sets.
- This opportunity seems to be more aligned to make my long term goals and aspirations.

## Biggest Challenge

- We faced a critical issue in our payment service where customers were experiencing delays in **payment processing**. Since our system is built using a microservices architecture, the problem could have been in any of the services interacting with payments, like user authentication, account balance, or transaction history.

- As the Senior developer, I started by analyzing **application logs** and used **distributed tracing** to follow the request path across services. This helped me see where the delay was happening. I also checked our **performance monitoring** dashboards to identify any **spikes** in **response time.**

- The issue was intermittent, so I performed **load testing** to **simulate high-traffic scenarios.** Through this, I discovered that a specific database query in the payment service was causing a **bottleneck**. I optimized the query by **adding indexes** and **restructuring part of the data model**, which significantly improved its performance.

- To further reduce database hits, I implemented **caching for frequently accessed data**. I also applied the Circuit Breaker pattern to prevent failures in one service from affecting the others. Additionally, I reviewed and improved our retry mechanisms and error handling to make the service more resilient.

- Finally, I added **alerting and monitoring** for key metrics to **detect issues early and act quickly** in the future. These changes reduced latency, improved reliability, and helped avoid future outages. This effort was recognized by the leadership team, and I was given an award for successfully resolving this high-priority issue and improving overall **system stability**

# Future Goals

- I’m currently working as a Senior Software Developer, and my goal is to continue improving my technical skills,
  especially in Java and backend technologies.
- While I do plan to take on leadership roles in the future.
- For now, I’m focused on growing as a strong individual contributor, due to some family responsibilities and because
  I’m currently pursuing an MBA.
- In the long term, I aim to take up a role where I can combine my technical experience and leadership skills to
  contribute to the company’s success.
