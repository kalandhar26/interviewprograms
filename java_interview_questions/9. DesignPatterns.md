## Singleton Pattern

**What it does:** Ensures only one instance of a class exists in the entire application.
**Real-life example:** Like having only one CEO in a company – no matter who asks for the CEO, they get the same person.
**defination** The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to
it. It’s a creational design pattern used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
A typical use case includes components like loggers, configuration managers, or database connections (DataSource) where
multiple instantiations could lead to resource issues or inconsistent behavior.

## Prototype Pattern

**What it does:** Lets you clone existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch.
**Real-life example:** Like photocopying a document – you duplicate the original instead of writing a new one.
**defination** The Prototype pattern is used when the cost of creating a new object is expensive. Instead of creating a
new object from scratch, this pattern allows you to clone existing objects.
It’s a creational pattern that helps improve performance by avoiding repeated expensive object creation.
It's especially useful when object initialization is heavy or when object structures are complex.

## Factory Pattern

**What it does:** Creates objects without exposing the creation logic. You ask for a "vehicle", and it gives you a car
or bike.
**Real-life example:** A pizza shop where you just say "I want a pizza" (factory decides if it's veg or non-veg).
**defination** The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type
of objects that will be created.
This is also a creational pattern that promotes loose coupling by delegating the instantiation logic to child classes.
It is often used when the client doesn’t know exactly which type to instantiate.

## Abstract Factory Pattern

**What it does:** Creates families of related objects (e.g., all UI elements for Windows/Mac).
**Real-life example:** Buying a furniture set (all pieces match the same style – modern/classic).
**defination** The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.
It’s considered a factory of factories and is part of creational design patterns.
This is useful when your system needs to be platform-independent or theme-based, where multiple families of related
products need to be created together.

## Builder Pattern

**What it does:** Constructs complex objects step by step (like customizing a computer).
**Real-life example:** Ordering a burger with specific toppings (bun, patty, cheese, etc.).
**defination** The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step-by-step.
It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.
It’s a creational pattern that increases readability, flexibility, and maintainability of object construction especially
when an object has many optional fields.

## Adapter Pattern

**What it does:** Lets incompatible interfaces work together (like a USB-C to HDMI adapter).
**Real-life example:** A power plug adapter that lets you charge a foreign device.
**defination** The Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
It allows two unrelated classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by
the clients.

It falls under structural design patterns because it is concerned with class and object composition.

## Proxy Pattern

**What it does:** Acts as a placeholder for another object to control access (like a bank proxy card).
**Real-life example:** A receptionist who filters calls before connecting to the CEO.
**defination** The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

It’s a structural pattern that can be used for lazy initialization, access control, logging, caching, etc.

## Intercepting Filter Pattern

**What it does**: Processes requests through a chain of filters (like airport security checks).
**Real-life example:** Email spam filters that check messages before they reach your inbox.
**defination** The Intercepting Filter pattern allows pre-processing and post-processing of requests or responses.

It’s commonly used in web frameworks or middleware, where you want to apply filters like authentication, logging, or
input validation without changing core logic.

## Strategy Pattern

**What it does:** Lets you switch algorithms at runtime (like choosing payment methods).
**Real-life example:** Selecting a route on Google Maps (driving/walking/biking).
**defination** The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them
interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

This is a behavioral design pattern that promotes flexibility and extensibility, often used when you have multiple ways
to perform an operation like payment, sorting, or compression.
