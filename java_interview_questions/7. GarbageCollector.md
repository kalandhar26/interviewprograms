# How Garbage Collector Works?

## Purpose:

- "Java’s Garbage Collector automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, preventing memory leaks, and
  eliminating manual memory management errors.

## Core Mechanism:

→ **"GC works in two main steps:**

- Garbage collection (GC) in Java is an automatic memory management process. It frees up memory by removing objects that
  are no longer needed by the application, preventing memory leaks and reducing the risk of running out of memory.
- Identify Garbage: Finds objects no longer reachable by the program (i.e., no live thread references them).
- Reclaim Memory: Frees the memory occupied by those objects."

## Generational Collection (Key Concept):

- **Java’s heap is divided into generations to optimize GC performance**
- **Young Generation (Eden + Survivor Spaces):** New objects are created here. Minor GCs (frequent, fast) clean this
  space.
- **Old Generation:** Long-lived objects are promoted here. Major GCs (less frequent, slower) clean this space.
- **Metaspace (Java 8+):** Stores class metadata (replaced PermGen)."
- **Permanent Generation:** Its main purpose was to store class metadata, such as information about classes, methods,
  and static variables, rather than regular Java objects (PremGem removed from java8)
- **G1 GC (Default since Java 9):** Balances latency/throughput, divides heap into regions.

# Java Memory Model

- The JMM defines how memory is structured and managed in the JVM, ensuring efficient allocation, garbage collection,
  and thread safety. It defines how threads interact with memory, ensuring visibility and ordering of operations.

## Main Components of Java Memory Architecture

| Memory Area          | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Heap**             | Dynamic memory area for all Java objects and arrays. Managed by Garbage Collector.           |
| **Metaspace**        | Stores class metadata, static variables, and method bytecode. Replaced PermGen since Java 8. |
| **Stack**            | Thread-private area for method frames, local variables, and return addresses.                |
| **Native Stack**     | Supports native method execution (e.g., JNI calls to C/C++).                                 |
| **Execution Engine** | Executes bytecode using interpreter + JIT compiler.                                          |

## Heap Structure in Java 21

### Young Generation

- Where new objects are allocated
- Subdivided into:
    - **Eden Space**: Initial allocation area
    - **Two Survivor Spaces (S0, S1)**: Objects that survive GC cycles
- **Minor GC**: Cleans Young Generation (fast and frequent)

### Old Generation (Tenured)

- Stores long-lived objects
- **Major GC (Full GC)**: Cleans Old Generation (less frequent but slower)

## Metaspace

- Stores class metadata and static information
- Grows automatically as needed
- Not subject to regular heap GC
- Eliminated "OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space" issues

## Thread Stacks

- Each thread has its own stack
- Contains:
    - Method call frames
    - Local variables
    - Return addresses
- Stack memory is thread-private (ensures thread safety for local variables)

## Garbage Collection in Java 21

### G1 Garbage Collector (Default)

- Divides heap into regions
- Collects regions with most garbage first
- Designed for low-pause times

### Generational ZGC (New in Java 21)

- Separates young and old objects
- Sub-millisecond pause times
- Optimized for:
    - High allocation rates
    - Many long-lived objects

### GC Characteristics

- All GCs are "Stop the World" events
- Modern collectors minimize pause times:
    - Concurrent marking
    - Parallel collection
    - Generational collection

## Key Improvements in Java 21

1. **Generational ZGC** (JEP 439): Better performance for applications with mixed object lifetimes
2. **Memory Management Optimizations**: Reduced overhead for concurrent operations
3. **Virtual Thread Integration**: More efficient stack memory usage
