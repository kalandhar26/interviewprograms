# Object Oriented Programming Guide

## Polymorphism

- principle that allows one entity (such as a method or object) to take many forms. Polymorphism allows one interface to
  represent multiple forms. In Java, it enables flexible and reusable code by letting objects of different classes be
  treated as objects of a common superclass.

**Types of Polymorphism:**

-- *Compile Time Polymorphism / Static Binding / Early Binding* :

- Achieved through method overloading.
- Resolved at compile time.
- Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters types or counts.

-- *Run Time Polymorphism / Dynamic Binding / Late Binding* :

- Achieved through method overriding.
- Resolved at Run time.
- Subclass provides a new implementation of an inherited method.

## Encapsulation

- It is the mechanism of hiding the internal state (data) of an object and restricting direct access to it. Instead,
  access is provided through public methods (getters and setters).
- It refers to bundling data (fields) and methods (behavior) inside a class while controlling access to the internal
  state.

### Implementation

- **Data Hiding (Private Fields)** : Fields are declared *private* to prevent direct external access.
- **Public Getters & Setters and Methods** : Use public getter/setter & methods to modify private fields.
- **Records (Java 16+)** : They provide a compact way to create *immutable data classes*. Automatically private final
  fields + getters.Records can implement interfaces but cannot extend classes (support polymorphism via interfaces).
- **Sealed Classes (Java 17+) for Controlled Inheritance** : They restricts which classes can extend a parent class and
  also enhances encapsulation by limiting subclassing.Restricts which classes can extend a parent, improving
  polymorphism safety.
- **Pattern Matching (Java 21) for Safer Data Access** : It Simplifies type-checking and extraction in encapsulated
  objects. Simplifies instance checks and casting in polymorphic structures.
- **Static Factory Methods (Alternative to Constructors)** : It Encapsulates object creation logic.

## Abstraction

- Abstraction is an OOP principle that hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features. It
  helps
  in reducing complexity and improving maintainability. we can implement using abstract classes and interfaces.

-- **Abstract classes**

- Defines a template for subclasses but cannot be instantiated.
- Can have abstract methods (no body) and concrete methods.

-- **Interfaces** Java 8

- Pure abstraction before Java 8 (only method declarations).
- Now supports default, static, and private methods (Java 8+).
- Before Java 8, We need to implement the interface methods in all the implemented classes, Even for some classes some
  methods are not required also we need to implement them forcefully where maintenance problem arises.
- To fix the above issue default methods are introduced in interfaces. We can implement these method in which ever
  classes are required.
- Before Java 8, Instance variables and methods are always associated with class Object But static methods and variables
  are never associated with Class Objects. When static methods are never associated with classes why should one declare
  in classes as they are heavy weighted where as interfaces are light weight.
- Before java 9, When multiple default or static methods in an interface share common code, writing that common logic
  again and again cause code duplication. Private methods in interfaces enhance code reusability and maintainability
  within the interface itself.

-- **Records** Java 16

- Provides a compact way to define immutable data classes.
- Automatically generates equals(), hashCode(), toString().

-- **Sealed Classes** Java 17

- Restricts which classes can implement an interface
- Improves controlled abstraction

-- **Pattern Matching** Java 21

- Simplifies type-checking and extraction in abstract hierarchies.

-- **Static & Factory Methods (Alternative to Constructors)**

- Encapsulates object creation logic.

## Inheritance:

- In Java inheritance means allowing one class to acquire the properties (fields and methods) of another class.
- Superclass (Parent class): The class being inherited from.
- Subclass (Child class): The class that inherits from another class.
- extends: Keyword used to inherit from a class
- final classes cannot be inherited and final methods cannot be overridden.
- super keyword can access parent class methods and constructor chaining.

-> **Types**

- **Single Inheritance**
- **Multilevel Inheritance**
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**
- Java doesn't support **multiple inheritance** with classes to avoid the **"diamond problem"**.
- Parent class methods are by default available to child class through inheritance. If in case multiple parent class
  having same method, but when child want to access that method JVM confuses which method to execute.
- **Multiple Inheritance** at interface level is allowed. Interfaces only contain method declarations (no
  implementations).Implementation is provided solely by the implementing class.

## Is-a Relationship (Inheritance)

- An **"Is-a"** relationship represents inheritance, where one class is a specialized version of another class.

## Has-a Relationship (Composition)

- A **"Has-a"** relationship represents composition, where one class contains an instance of another class as a member.

| **Aspect**       | **Is-a Relationship**          | **Has-a Relationship**         |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Keyword**      | extends / implements           | Member variable                |
| **Relationship** | Inheritance                    | Composition / Aggregation      |
| **Flexibility**  | Less flexible (tight coupling) | More flexible (loose coupling) |
| **Reusability**  | Inherits all parent features   | Selectively uses features      |
| **Access**       | Can access protected members   | Only accesses public members   |

**Notes**

1. Prefer composition (Has-a) over inheritance (Is-a) when possible - it's more flexible and reduces coupling
2. Use inheritance only when there's a clear hierarchical relationship
3. Consider the Liskov Substitution Principle: if a subclass can't properly substitute for its parent, composition is
   likely better
4. Use interfaces to achieve polymorphism without the tight coupling of class inheritance

## Abstract Class

- Abstract classes CAN have constructors in Java, Even though they can't be instantiated directly.
- Abstract class constructors are invoked automatically when a concrete subclass is instantiated. Its part of the normal
  constructor chaining process.
- To initialize the state of the abstract class when a concrete subclass is instantiated.
- To participate in the constructor call chain when subclass objects are created.
- To provide common initialization code for all subclasses.
- Abstract classes can have constructors, they cannot be marked as abstract - constructors are always concrete
  implementations.

## Composition (Strong "has-a" Relationship)

- A strict ownership relationship where the contained object cannot exist without the container
- The contained object's lifecycle is controlled by the container
- The container directly owns the contained object
- Typically created in constructor: The container creates its parts

## Aggregation (Weak "has-a" Relationship)

- A loose ownership relationship where the contained object can exist independently.
- The container holds a reference but doesn't manage the lifecycle.
- The container uses but doesn't own the object.
- Passed via constructor/setter: External objects can be injected
