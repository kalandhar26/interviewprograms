## Singleton Pattern

**What it does:** Ensures only one instance of a class exists in the entire application.
**Real-life example:** Like having only one CEO in a company – no matter who asks for the CEO, they get the same person.
**defination** The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to
it. It’s a creational design pattern used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
A typical use case includes components like loggers, configuration managers, or database connections (DataSource) where
multiple instantiations could lead to resource issues or inconsistent behavior.
- Ensures only one instance of a given class exists in the JVM and provides a global access point. Solves the problem of shared, expensive, or stateful resources (DB connection, config, logging).

```java
final class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton INSTANCE;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (INSTANCE == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (INSTANCE == null) INSTANCE = new Singleton();
            }
        }
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}

class SingletonDemo {
    static void run() {
        Singleton s1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton s2 = Singleton.getInstance();
        System.out.println("Singleton same? " + (s1 == s2));
    }
}
```

## Prototype Pattern

**What it does:** Lets you clone existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch.
**Real-life example:** Like photocopying a document – you duplicate the original instead of writing a new one.
**defination** The Prototype pattern is used when the cost of creating a new object is expensive. Instead of creating a
new object from scratch, this pattern allows you to clone existing objects.
It’s a creational pattern that helps improve performance by avoiding repeated expensive object creation.
It's especially useful when object initialization is heavy or when object structures are complex.
- Create new objects by cloning an existing (prototype) instance instead of new. Useful when object creation is expensive or when we need many similar objects.

```java
import java.util.*;

record Point(int x, int y) implements Cloneable {
    @Override public Point clone() { return new Point(x, y); }
}

class Shape implements Cloneable {
    private final List<Point> points = new ArrayList<>();
    public void addPoint(Point p) { points.add(p); }
    public List<Point> getPoints() { return points; }

    @Override public Shape clone() {
        Shape copy = new Shape();
        points.forEach(p -> copy.addPoint(p.clone()));
        return copy;
    }
}

class PrototypeDemo {
    static void run() {
        Shape template = new Shape();
        template.addPoint(new Point(0, 0));
        template.addPoint(new Point(1, 1));

        Shape copy = template.clone();
        copy.addPoint(new Point(2, 2));
        System.out.println("Prototype copy has " + copy.getPoints().size() + " points");
    }
}
```

## Factory Pattern

**What it does:** Creates objects without exposing the creation logic. You ask for a "vehicle", and it gives you a car
or bike.
**Real-life example:** A pizza shop where you just say "I want a pizza" (factory decides if it's veg or non-veg).
**defination** The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type
of objects that will be created.
This is also a creational pattern that promotes loose coupling by delegating the instantiation logic to child classes.
It is often used when the client doesn’t know exactly which type to instantiate.
- Encapsulate object creation logic behind a static method so client code never uses new.

```java
interface Vehicle { void drive(); }

class Car implements Vehicle { public void drive() { System.out.println("Car driving"); } }
class Bike implements Vehicle { public void drive() { System.out.println("Bike driving"); } }

class VehicleFactory {
    public static Vehicle create(String type) {
        return switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "car" -> new Car();
            case "bike" -> new Bike();
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown vehicle");
        };
    }
}

class FactoryDemo {
    static void run() {
        Vehicle v = VehicleFactory.create("bike");
        v.drive();
    }
}
```

## Abstract Factory Pattern

**What it does:** Creates families of related objects (e.g., all UI elements for Windows/Mac).
**Real-life example:** Buying a furniture set (all pieces match the same style – modern/classic).
**defination** The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.
It’s considered a factory of factories and is part of creational design patterns.
This is useful when your system needs to be platform-independent or theme-based, where multiple families of related
products need to be created together.

- Provide an interface for creating families of related objects (GUI toolkit, DB drivers) without specifying their concrete classes.

```java
interface Button { void paint(); }
interface Checkbox { void paint(); }

class WinButton implements Button { public void paint() { System.out.println("WinButton"); } }
class MacButton implements Button { public void paint() { System.out.println("MacButton"); } }

class WinCheckbox implements Checkbox { public void paint() { System.out.println("WinCheckbox"); } }
class MacCheckbox implements Checkbox { public void paint() { System.out.println("MacCheckbox"); } }

interface GUIFactory {
    Button createButton();
    Checkbox createCheckbox();
}

class WinFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() { return new WinButton(); }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new WinCheckbox(); }
}

class MacFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() { return new MacButton(); }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new MacCheckbox(); }
}

class AbstractFactoryDemo {
    static void run() {
        GUIFactory factory = System.getProperty("os.name").startsWith("Mac") ? new MacFactory() : new WinFactory();
        Button btn = factory.createButton();
        Checkbox chk = factory.createCheckbox();
        btn.paint(); chk.paint();
    }
}
```

## Builder Pattern

**What it does:** Constructs complex objects step by step (like customizing a computer).
**Real-life example:** Ordering a burger with specific toppings (bun, patty, cheese, etc.).
**defination** The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step-by-step.
It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.
It’s a creational pattern that increases readability, flexibility, and maintainability of object construction especially
when an object has many optional fields.
- Construct complex immutable objects step-by-step, separating construction from representation. Eliminates telescoping constructors.
```java
final class House {
    private final int rooms;
    private final boolean garage;
    private final String material;

    private House(Builder b) {
        this.rooms = b.rooms;
        this.garage = b.garage;
        this.material = b.material;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private int rooms = 0;
        private boolean garage = false;
        private String material = "wood";

        public Builder rooms(int r) { this.rooms = r; return this; }
        public Builder garage(boolean g) { this.garage = g; return this; }
        public Builder material(String m) { this.material = m; return this; }
        public House build() { return new House(this); }
    }
}

class BuilderDemo {
    static void run() {
        House h = new House.Builder()
                           .rooms(4)
                           .garage(true)
                           .material("concrete")
                           .build();
        System.out.println("House built: " + h);
    }
}
```

## Adapter Pattern

**What it does:** Lets incompatible interfaces work together (like a USB-C to HDMI adapter).
**Real-life example:** A power plug adapter that lets you charge a foreign device.
**defination** The Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
It allows two unrelated classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by
the clients.

It falls under structural design patterns because it is concerned with class and object composition.
- Convert the interface of an existing class into another interface clients expect. Allows classes to work together that otherwise couldn’t.

```java
interface MediaPlayer { void play(String filename); }
interface AdvancedMediaPlayer { void playVlc(String f); void playMp4(String f); }

class VlcPlayer implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public void playVlc(String f) { System.out.println("Playing vlc " + f); }
    public void playMp4(String f) {}
}

class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    private final AdvancedMediaPlayer adv = new VlcPlayer();
    public void play(String filename) {
        if (filename.endsWith(".vlc")) adv.playVlc(filename);
    }
}

class AdapterDemo {
    static void run() {
        MediaPlayer player = new MediaAdapter();
        player.play("movie.vlc");
    }
}
```

## Proxy Pattern

**What it does:** Acts as a placeholder for another object to control access (like a bank proxy card).
**Real-life example:** A receptionist who filters calls before connecting to the CEO.
**defination** The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

It’s a structural pattern that can be used for lazy initialization, access control, logging, caching, etc.
Provide a surrogate or placeholder to control access (lazy loading, caching, security).
```java
interface Image { void display(); }

class RealImage implements Image {
    private final String file;
    RealImage(String f) { this.file = f; load(); }
    private void load() { System.out.println("Loading " + file); }
    public void display() { System.out.println("Displaying " + file); }
}

class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private final String file;
    private RealImage real;
    ProxyImage(String f) { this.file = f; }
    public void display() {
        if (real == null) real = new RealImage(file);
        real.display();
    }
}

class ProxyDemo {
    static void run() {
        Image img = new ProxyImage("big.jpg");
        System.out.println("Proxy created");
        img.display();   // loads & shows
        img.display();   // shows from cache
    }
}
```

## Intercepting Filter Pattern

**What it does**: Processes requests through a chain of filters (like airport security checks).
**Real-life example:** Email spam filters that check messages before they reach your inbox.
**defination** The Intercepting Filter pattern allows pre-processing and post-processing of requests or responses.

It’s commonly used in web frameworks or middleware, where you want to apply filters like authentication, logging, or
input validation without changing core logic.

## Strategy Pattern

**What it does:** Lets you switch algorithms at runtime (like choosing payment methods).
**Real-life example:** Selecting a route on Google Maps (driving/walking/biking).
**defination** The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them
interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

This is a behavioral design pattern that promotes flexibility and extensibility, often used when you have multiple ways
to perform an operation like payment, sorting, or compression.
- Define a family of interchangeable algorithms and make them swappable at runtime.

```java
interface PaymentStrategy { void pay(int amount); }

class CreditCardStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amt) { System.out.println("Paid " + amt + " with credit card"); }
}
class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amt) { System.out.println("Paid " + amt + " with PayPal"); }
}

class ShoppingCart {
    private final List<Integer> prices = new ArrayList<>();
    public void add(int p) { prices.add(p); }
    public void pay(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        int total = prices.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();
        strategy.pay(total);
    }
}

class StrategyDemo {
    static void run() {
        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
        cart.add(100); cart.add(50);
        cart.pay(new PayPalStrategy());
    }
}
```
