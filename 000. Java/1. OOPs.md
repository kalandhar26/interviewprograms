## 1. Method Overloading

- Method Overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (
  different type, number, or both). It helps in increasing the readability of the program.

```java
class Overloading {

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display method");
    }

    void display(int a) {
        System.out.println("Display method with int parameter");
    }

    void display(String a) {
        System.out.println("Display method with String parameter");
    }
}
```

## 2. Method Overriding

- Method Overriding occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name and parameters as a method in its superclass.
- In overriding, the method in the subclass is used instead of the one in the superclass, allowing for dynamic method
  dispatch and polymorphism.

```java
// Method Overriding
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Cat eats fish.");
    }
}
//eat() method overridden
```

## 3. Method Hiding

- Method Hiding occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same name and method signature as a static
  method in its superclass.
- The method to be executed is decided at compile time, based on the reference type, not the object type. Unlike method
  overriding, method hiding does not support runtime polymorphism.

```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent static show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Child static show()");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Parent();
        Parent c = new Child();
        Child ch = new Child();

        p.show();   // Parent static show()
        c.show();   // Parent static show()
        ch.show();  // Child static show()
    }
}

```

## What is Polymorphism?

- Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It lets us perform a single action in
  different ways. Java supports polymorphism through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (
  compile-time polymorphism).

```java
class Bird {
    void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird flies.");
    }
}

class Parrot extends Bird {
    void fly() {
        System.out.println("Parrot is flying.");
    }
}
```

## What is Abstract class?
