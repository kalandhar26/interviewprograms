# Inner Classes in Java 21: A Simple Guide (Including Sealed Classes)

Inner classes in Java are classes defined inside another class, used to logically group related classes and encapsulate
functionality. They were initially introduced to support GUI event handling and are ideal when one object depends on
another (a "has-a" relationship). This guide covers the four types of inner classes, their use cases, restrictions, and
how sealed classes in Java 21 can be used with them to restrict inheritance. Each section includes simple,
beginner-friendly code examples.

## Why Use Inner Classes?

Inner classes are used when one type of object cannot exist without another. For example:

- A `Map` contains `Entry` objects; an `Entry` doesn’t exist without a `Map`.
- Inner class objects typically require an outer class object to exist, except for static nested classes.
- To keep code clean and organized.
- To logically associate classes that are only used together.
- To access outer class members easily.

## Types of Inner Classes

Java supports four types of inner classes based on their declaration and behavior:

1. **Regular Inner Class (Normal Inner Class)**
2. **Method-Local Inner Class**
3. **Anonymous Inner Class**
4. **Static Nested Class**

---

## 1. Regular Inner Class (RIC)

A **Regular Inner Class** is a named class declared directly inside another class, outside any method, without the
`static` modifier.

### Key Characteristics

- **Strong Association**: Requires an outer class instance to exist.
- **Access**: Can access both instance and static members of the outer class.
- **Restrictions**: Cannot declare `static` members (e.g., `main` method), so it cannot be run directly from the command
  line.
- **Compilation**: Generates two `.class` files: `OuterClassName.class` and `OuterClassName$InnerClassName.class`.
- **Modifiers**: Can use `public`, `protected`, `private`, `default`, `final`, `abstract`, or `strictfp`.

### Example: Regular Inner Class

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private String outerField = "Outer Field";
    private static String staticOuterField = "Static Outer Field";

    // Regular Inner Class
    class InnerClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Accessing: " + outerField);
            System.out.println("Accessing: " + staticOuterField);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
        OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();
        inner.display();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Accessing: Outer Field
Accessing: Static Outer Field
```

---

## 2. Method-Local Inner Class (MLIC)

A **Method-Local Inner Class** is defined inside a method, used for method-specific, reusable logic.

### Key Characteristics

- **Scope**: Only accessible within the method.
- **Access**:
    - In instance methods: Can access instance and static members of the outer class.
    - In static methods: Can only access static members.
- **Variable Access**: Can only access `final` or **effectively final** method-local variables (unchanged after
  initialization, Java 8+).
- **Restrictions**: Cannot declare `static` members. Allowed modifiers: `final`, `abstract`, `strictfp`.
- **Use Case**: Rare, used for method-specific logic like event handling.

### Example: Method-Local Inner Class

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private String outerField = "Outer Field";
    private static String staticOuterField = "Static Outer Field";

    void outerMethod() {
        final String localVar = "Local Variable";

        class MethodLocalInner {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Accessing: " + outerField);
                System.out.println("Accessing: " + staticOuterField);
                System.out.println("Accessing: " + localVar);
            }
        }

        MethodLocalInner inner = new MethodLocalInner();
        inner.display();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
        outer.outerMethod();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Accessing: Outer Field
Accessing: Static Outer Field
Accessing: Local Variable
```

## 3. Anonymous Inner Class (AIC)

An **Anonymous Inner Class** is a nameless class defined inline, typically for one-time use.

### Key Characteristics

- **Purpose**: For instant or temporary use, avoiding named classes.
- **Types**:
    1. Extends a class.
    2. Implements an interface.
    3. Defined in method arguments.
- **Restrictions**: Can extend one class or implement one interface at a time; no constructors.
- **Use Case**: Common in GUI event handling or quick interface implementations.

### Example: AIC Implementing Runnable

```java
public class AICThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                    System.out.println("Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                }
            }
        };
        new Thread(runnable).start();

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}
```

**Output** (order may vary):

```
Main: main
Main: main
Main: main
Thread: Thread-0
Thread: Thread-0
Thread: Thread-0
```

---

## 4. Static Nested Class (SNC)

A **Static Nested Class** is an inner class with the `static` modifier, less dependent on the outer class.

### Key Characteristics

- **Weak Association**: Can exist without an outer class instance.
- **Access**: Can only access `static` members of the outer class directly.
- **Static Members**: Can declare `static` members, including `main`, allowing direct invocation.
- **Use Case**: Utility classes related to the outer class.

### Example: Static Nested Class

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private static String staticOuterField = "Static Outer Field";
    private String instanceField = "Instance Field";

    static class StaticNestedClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Accessing: " + staticOuterField);
            OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
            System.out.println("Accessing via outer instance: " + outer.instanceField);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticNestedClass nested = new StaticNestedClass();
        nested.display();
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Accessing: Static Outer Field
Accessing via outer instance: Instance Field
```

## Sealed Classes with Inner Classes in Java 21

Java 21 supports **sealed classes** (introduced in Java 17 as a standard feature, JEP 409), which allow you to restrict
which classes can extend or implement a class or interface. When combined with inner classes, sealed classes provide
fine-grained control over inheritance, ensuring only specific inner or external classes can extend them. This is useful
for modeling hierarchies where you want to limit extensibility for security or design clarity.

### Key Characteristics of Sealed Classes

- **Syntax**: Use the `sealed` modifier and specify permitted subclasses with `permits`.
- **Permitted Subclasses**: Must be in the same module (or package if unnamed module) and can be inner classes or
  external classes.
- **Subclasses**: Must be `final`, `sealed`, or `non-sealed`.
- **Use with Inner Classes**: Sealed classes can be outer classes, inner classes, or static nested classes, restricting
  their inheritance.

### Sealed Classes and Inner Classes

- **Regular Inner Classes**: Can be sealed to restrict which classes extend them, often inner or external classes.
- **Static Nested Classes**: Commonly used with sealed classes since they are independent and align with sealed class
  hierarchies.
- **Method-Local Inner Classes**: Rarely used with sealed classes due to their limited scope.
- **Anonymous 内 Classes**: Cannot be sealed (they are nameless and implicitly `final`).

### Example 1: Sealed Outer Class with Inner Classes

Here, the outer class is sealed, and only specific inner classes can extend it.

```java
public sealed class Vehicle permits Vehicle.Car, Vehicle.Bike {
    private String type;

    Vehicle(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    String getType() {
        return type;
    }

    // Regular Inner Class
    final class Car extends Vehicle {
        Car() {
            super("Car");
        }
    }

    // Static Nested Class
    static final class Bike extends Vehicle {
        Bike() {
            super("Bike");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Vehicle("Car").new Car();
        Vehicle bike = new Bike();
        System.out.println("Car type: " + car.getType());
        System.out.println("Bike type: " + bike.getType());
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Car type: Car
Bike type: Bike
```

**Explanation**:

- `Vehicle` is sealed and permits only `Car` (a regular inner class) and `Bike` (a static nested class).
- `Car` and `Bike` are `final`, preventing further extension.
- `Car` requires the outer `Vehicle` instance (`new Vehicle("Car").new Car()`), while `Bike` can be instantiated
  directly (`new Bike()`).

### Example 2: Sealed Inner Class

Here, a regular inner class is sealed, restricting its subclasses to specific inner classes.

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private String outerField = "Outer Field";

    sealed class Shape permits OuterClass.Circle, OuterClass.Square {
        String getDescription() {
            return "A shape in " + outerField;
        }
    }

    final class Circle extends Shape {
        String getDescription() {
            return "Circle in " + outerField;
        }
    }

    final class Square extends Shape {
        String getDescription() {
            return "Square in " + outerField;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
        Shape circle = outer.new Circle();
        Shape square = outer.new Square();
        System.out.println(circle.getDescription());
        System.out.println(square.getDescription());
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Circle in Outer Field
Square in Outer Field
```

**Explanation**:

- `Shape` is a sealed regular inner class, permitting only `Circle` and `Square` (both inner classes).
- Both subclasses are `final`, preventing further extension.
- Instances require an outer class object (`outer.new Circle()`).

### Example 3: Sealed Static Nested Class

Static nested classes are often used with sealed classes for independent hierarchies.

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private static String staticField = "Static Field";

    sealed static class Animal permits OuterClass.Dog, OuterClass.Cat {
        String makeSound() {
            return "Generic sound from " + staticField;
        }
    }

    static final class Dog extends Animal {
        String makeSound() {
            return "Woof from " + staticField;
        }
    }

    static final class Cat extends Animal {
        String makeSound() {
            return "Meow from " + staticField;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        Animal cat = new Cat();
        System.out.println(dog.makeSound());
        System.out.println(cat.makeSound());
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Woof from Static Field
Meow from Static Field
```

**Explanation**:

- `Animal` is a sealed static nested class, permitting only `Dog` and `Cat`.
- Both subclasses are `final` and static, so they don’t require an outer instance.
- Accesses only `static` members of the outer class (`staticField`).

### Example 4: Sealed Interface with Inner Class

A sealed interface can include inner classes as permitted implementers.

```java
public class OuterClass {
    sealed interface Vehicle permits OuterClass.ElectricCar, OuterClass.Motorcycle {
        String getType();
    }

    static final class ElectricCar implements Vehicle {
        public String getType() {
            return "Electric Car";
        }
    }

    static final class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
        public String getType() {
            return "Motorcycle";
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new ElectricCar();
        Vehicle bike = new Motorcycle();
        System.out.println(car.getType());
        System.out.println(bike.getType());
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Electric Car
Motorcycle
```

**Explanation**:

- `Vehicle` is a sealed interface inside `OuterClass`, permitting `ElectricCar` and `Motorcycle` (static nested
  classes).
- Both implementers are `final` and static, allowing direct instantiation.

## Nested Classes and Interfaces Combinations

Inner classes can involve interfaces in various ways:

### Case 1: Class Inside a Class

- **Use Case**: When one object depends on another (e.g., `University` contains `Department`).
- **Example**:

```java
public class University {
    class Department {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Department in University");
        }
    }
}
```

### Case 2: Interface Inside a Class

- Interfaces inside classes are implicitly `static`.
- **Example**:

```java
public class OuterClass {
    interface InnerInterface {
        void doSomething();
    }
}
```

### Case 3: Interface Inside an Interface

- Always `public` and `static` (e.g., `Map.Entry` inside `Map`).
- **Example**:

```java
public interface OuterInterface {
    interface InnerInterface {
        void doSomething();
    }
}
```

### Case 4: Class Inside an Interface

- Always `public` and `static`, used for tightly coupled functionality.
- **Example**:

```java
public interface EmailService {
    void sendMail(EmailDetails details);

    class EmailDetails {
        String toList;

        EmailDetails(String toList) {
            this.toList = toList;
        }
    }
}
```

## Comparison of Inner Class Types

| Feature                     | Regular Inner Class      | Method-Local Inner Class                  | Anonymous Inner Class | Static Nested Class    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Declaration**             | Inside class, non-static | Inside a method                           | Nameless, inline      | Inside class, `static` |
| **Outer Object Dependency** | Required                 | Required (if in instance method)          | Depends on context    | Independent            |
| **Static Members**          | Not allowed              | Not allowed                               | Not allowed           | Allowed                |
| **Access to Outer Members** | Instance + Static        | Instance + Static (if in instance method) | Depends on context    | Static only            |
| **Main Method**             | Not allowed              | Not allowed                               | Not allowed           | Allowed                |
| **Sealed Class Support**    | Can be sealed            | Rarely used with sealed                   | Cannot be sealed      | Can be sealed          |

## Java 21 Specifics

- **Sealed Classes**: Introduced in Java 17, standard in Java 21, sealed classes enhance inner classes by restricting
  inheritance. They are particularly useful for static nested classes and regular inner classes in controlled
  hierarchies.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Prefer lambdas over Anonymous Inner Classes for functional interfaces (e.g., `Runnable`).
- **Record Classes**: Can be used as static nested classes but not regular inner classes (records are `final`).
- **No Major Changes**: Inner class behavior remains consistent with Java 8+.

### Example: Static Nested Record with Sealed Class

```java
public class OuterClass {
    sealed interface Shape permits OuterClass.Circle {
        String getName();
    }

    static record Circle(double radius) implements Shape {
        public String getName() {
            return "Circle with radius " + radius;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5.0);
        System.out.println(circle.getName());
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Circle with radius 5.0
```

## Best Practices

- **Use Sealed Classes** to restrict inheritance in inner class hierarchies for better control and clarity.
- **Prefer Static Nested Classes** for sealed hierarchies when independence from the outer class is needed.
- **Use Regular Inner Classes** for sealed classes when tight coupling is required.
- **Keep Hierarchies Simple**: Avoid over-nesting or complex sealed class structures.
- **Use Lambdas** for functional interfaces instead of Anonymous Inner Classes.
