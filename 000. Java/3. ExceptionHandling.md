# What is an Exception?

- An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which prevents the program from continuing its
  normal flow.
- Exceptions are objects in Java, represented by classes that inherit from the Throwable class. There are two main
  subclasses:
- **Error:** Represents serious issues that a program typically cannot recover from (e.g., OutOfMemoryError,
  StackOverflowError).
- **Exception:** Represents conditions that a program can catch and handle (e.g., IOException, NullPointerException).
- Exception handling ensures robustness by managing these disruptions gracefully.

# Types of Exceptions in Java

## Checked Exceptions:

- These are exceptions that the compiler forces you to handle at compile time, either by catching them or declaring them
  with the throws keyword.
- Examples: IOException, SQLException, FileNotFoundException.
- Typically represent external issues (e.g., file not found, network issues).

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.FileReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("test.txt");
            FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found or cannot be read: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Unchecked Exceptions:

- These are not checked at compile time, and the compiler does not force you to handle them.
- Examples: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException.
- Typically represent programming errors or runtime issues.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(arr[5]); // Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid array index: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Errors:

- Errors are not meant to be caught or handled as they indicate severe problems (e.g., VirtualMachineError,
  OutOfMemoryError).
- Example: Running out of heap memory triggers OutOfMemoryError.

# Exception Handling Mechanisms

## try-catch Block:

- Used to catch and handle exceptions.
- Can have multiple catch blocks to handle different exceptions.

```aiignore
try {
    / Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    / Handle the exception
}
```

```aiignore
try {
    int result = 10 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## finally Block

- Executes regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught.
- Used for cleanup operations (e.g., closing files or database connections).

```aiignore
try {
    File file = new File("test.txt");
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("IO Error: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    System.out.println("This runs regardless of exception.");
}
```

## throws Keyword

- Used in method signatures to declare that a method can throw one or more exceptions.

```aiignore
public void readFile(String path) throws IOException {
    File file = new File(path);
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
}
```

## throw Keyword:

- Used to explicitly throw an exception.

```aiignore
public void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Access granted.");
    }
}
```

## Custom Exceptions

- You can create your own exceptions by extending the Exception class (for checked exceptions) or RuntimeException (for
  unchecked exceptions).

```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkAge(15);
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Custom exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    static void checkAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or older.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access granted.");
        }
    }
}
```

# Exception Inheritance in Java?

- In Java, exceptions are objects that inherit from the Throwable class, which has two direct subclasses: Error and
  Exception. The Exception class is further divided into checked and unchecked exceptions:

- Checked Exceptions: Inherit from Exception (but not RuntimeException).
- Examples include IOException, SQLException. The compiler enforces handling or declaring these exceptions.
- Unchecked Exceptions: Inherit from RuntimeException (a subclass of Exception).
- Examples include NullPointerException, ArithmeticException. These are not enforced by the compiler.
- Errors: Inherit from Error (e.g., OutOfMemoryError). These are typically not caught or handled.
- The concept of exception inheritance becomes particularly important when dealing with method overriding in a class
  hierarchy, as there are specific rules about how exceptions can be declared in overridden methods.

## Rules for Exception Handling in Method Overriding

- When a child class overrides a method from a parent class, the following rules apply regarding exceptions:

### Checked Exceptions

- If the child class’s overridden method throws a checked exception, the parent class’s method must declare the same
  checked exception or a parent class of that exception (a more general exception). Otherwise, you’ll get a compile-time
  error.
- The child class cannot throw a broader checked exception than the one declared in the parent class’s method.

```java
class Parent {
    void display() throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() throws FileNotFoundException { // FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

- The above code compiles because FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException.

```java
class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() throws Exception { // Broader exception
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

- the above code would cause a compile-time error
- This fails because Exception is a broader checked exception than IOException.

```java
class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() { // No exception thrown
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

- The child class’s method can also choose not to throw any exceptions, even if the parent class’s method declares a
  checked exception

### Unchecked Exceptions:

- There are no restrictions on unchecked exceptions in overridden methods. The child class’s method can throw any
  unchecked exceptions (RuntimeException or its subclasses) without requiring the parent class’s method to declare them.

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() throws NullPointerException { // Unchecked exception
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

- This compiles fine because NullPointerException is an unchecked exception, and the compiler doesn’t enforce any rules
  for it.

### No New Checked Exceptions:

- The child class’s overridden method cannot introduce a new checked exception that isn’t declared in the parent class’s
  method.
- This will cause a compile-time error because the parent class’s method doesn’t declare IOException or a parent of it.

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() throws IOException { // New checked exception
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

# Understanding Fully Checked and Partially Checked Exceptions

## Fully Checked Exception:

- A checked exception is considered fully checked if all of its subclasses are also checked exceptions.
- Example: IOException is a fully checked exception because all its subclasses (e.g., FileNotFoundException,
  EOFException) are also checked exceptions.
- When a method declares a fully checked exception like IOException, any overridden method in a child class must throw
  IOException or one of its subclasses (or no checked exceptions at all).

## Partially Checked Exception:

- A checked exception is considered partially checked if some of its subclasses are unchecked exceptions.
- Example: Exception is a partially checked exception because it has both checked subclasses (e.g., IOException) and
  unchecked subclasses (e.g., RuntimeException, NullPointerException).
- When a parent class method declares Exception, the child class’s overridden method can throw any checked exception (
  e.g., IOException) or unchecked exception (e.g., NullPointerException) because Exception is a superclass of both.

```java
class Parent {
    void display() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() throws IOException, NullPointerException {
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}
```

- This compiles because IOException (checked) and NullPointerException (unchecked) are both subclasses of Exception.

```java
class Parent {
    void method1() throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Parent method1");
    }

    void method2() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Parent method2");
    }

    void method3() {
        System.out.println("Parent method3");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void method1() throws FileNotFoundException { // Valid: FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException
        System.out.println("Child method1");
    }

    @Override
    void method2() throws IOException, NullPointerException { // Valid: Both are subclasses of Exception
        System.out.println("Child method2");
    }

    @Override
    void method3() throws RuntimeException { // Valid: Unchecked exception
        System.out.println("Child method3");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent parent = new Child();
        try {
            parent.method1();
            parent.method2();
            parent.method3();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

# Exception Propagation in the Context of Inheritance

- Exception propagation refers to how an exception thrown in a method travels up the call stack until it is either
  caught or causes the program to terminate. In the context of inheritance, particularly with method overriding, the
  rules for exception handling (as discussed previously) influence how exceptions propagate from a child class to a
  parent class or calling code.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

class Parent {
    void display() throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
        throw new IOException("Error in parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() throws FileNotFoundException { // Narrower checked exception
        System.out.println("Child display");
        throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found in child");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child(); // Polymorphism
        try {
            obj.display(); // Calls Child's display(), throws FileNotFoundException
        } catch (IOException e) { // Catches FileNotFoundException (subclass of IOException)
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- The Child class overrides display() and throws a FileNotFoundException (a subclass of IOException).
- When obj.display() is called, the child’s display() method executes (due to polymorphism) and throws a
  FileNotFoundException.
- The exception propagates to the main method, where it’s caught by the catch (IOException e) block, as
  FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException.
- If the main method didn’t catch the exception, it would propagate further up the call stack, potentially terminating
  the program.

## Unchecked Exception Propagation:

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display");
        throw new NullPointerException("Null error in child");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        try {
            obj.display(); // Throws NullPointerException
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- The child class throws an unchecked NullPointerException, which isn’t declared in the parent’s method.
- The exception propagates to the main method, where it’s caught. If not caught, it would terminate the program with a
  stack trace.

# Exception Inheritance Rules in Interfaces and Abstract Classes

## Exception Rules in Interfaces

- Methods in an interface can declare throws clauses for checked exceptions.
- When a class implements an interface, the implementing method must follow the same rules as method overriding:
- It can throw the same or narrower checked exceptions declared in the interface’s method.
- It cannot throw broader checked exceptions or new checked exceptions not declared in the interface.
- It can throw any unchecked exceptions without restriction.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

interface MyInterface {
    void perform() throws IOException;
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void perform() throws FileNotFoundException { // Narrower checked exception
        System.out.println("Performing action");
        throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface obj = new MyClass();
        try {
            obj.perform();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- The interface declares throws IOException, so the implementing class can throw FileNotFoundException (a subclass) or
  no exceptions.
- If MyClass tried to throw Exception (a broader checked exception), it would cause a compile-time error.

## Exception Rules in Abstract Classes

- Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, and the same exception rules apply as in regular
  inheritance.
- If an abstract method declares a throws clause, any concrete subclass overriding that method must adhere to the
  checked exception rules (same or narrower).
- If a concrete method in an abstract class is overridden, the same rules apply as in regular class inheritance.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

abstract class AbstractParent {
    abstract void process() throws IOException;

    void display() throws IOException {
        System.out.println("AbstractParent display");
    }
}

class ConcreteChild extends AbstractParent {
    @Override
    void process() throws FileNotFoundException { // Narrower checked exception
        System.out.println("Child process");
        throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found");
    }

    @Override
    void display() { // No exception thrown
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractParent obj = new ConcreteChild();
        try {
            obj.process();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        obj.display(); // No exception thrown
    }
}
```

- The abstract method process() declares throws IOException, so the child class can throw FileNotFoundException or no
  exceptions.
- The concrete method display() declares throws IOException, but the child class chooses not to throw any exceptions,
  which is valid.
- The exception from process() propagates to the main method and is caught.
