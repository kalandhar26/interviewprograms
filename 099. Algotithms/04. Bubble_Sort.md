# Bubble Sort

- Bubble Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent
  elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It "bubbles" the largest (or smallest) element to the end in
  each pass, like bubbles rising in water. It's easy to implement but inefficient for large datasets, making it more of
  an educational tool than a practical sorter.

## Key Characteristics:

- Best Case: O(n) – Already sorted (one pass detects no swaps).
- Average/Worst Case: O(n²) – Unsorted or reverse-sorted (many swaps).
- Space Complexity: O(1) – In-place sorting.
- Pros: Simple to code and understand; stable (preserves equal element order); adaptive (early termination if sorted).
- Cons: Quadratic time; not suitable for large n (use Quick/Merge/Heap instead).

## How It Works (Step-by-Step):

- For each pass (i from 0 to n-1):
- Traverse the array from the start to the unsorted portion (j from 0 to n-i-1).
- Compare adjacent elements: if arr[j] > arr[j+1], swap them.
- After each pass, the largest element "bubbles" to the end.
- The sorted portion grows from the end; repeat until no swaps needed (optimized version).
- For n elements, up to n-1 passes.
- The optimized version tracks if any swaps occurred in a pass—if none, the array is sorted and we exit early.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class BubbleSort {

    // Main Bubble Sort method
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        boolean swapped;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            swapped = false;  // Flag for optimization

            // Last i elements are already sorted
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap adjacent elements
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }

            // If no swaps, array is sorted—exit early
            if (!swapped) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example unsorted array
        int[] numbers = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};

        // Print original array
        System.out.println("Original Array: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));

        // Perform Bubble Sort
        bubbleSort(numbers);

        // Print sorted array
        System.out.println("Sorted Array: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));
    }
}
```
- output

```text
Original Array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted Array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
