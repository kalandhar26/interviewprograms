# Algorithms

In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), there are two key phases:

1. **Design Phase**
2. **Implementation Phase**

## Design Phase:
In this phase, we first design the program. Once the design is finalized, we move on to the implementation phase. Algorithms are used during the design phase, and it's essential to have domain knowledge to apply them effectively. Algorithms are independent of specific hardware and software. It's crucial to analyze the algorithm for efficiency.

## Implementation Phase:
In this phase, the program is written. The programmer can develop the code based on the design. This phase is dependent on the hardware and software used. Once the program is written, it must be tested for correctness and performance.

## Types of Analysis:

### Priori Analysis:
1. Performed on the algorithm before implementation, and is independent of hardware and language.
2. Focuses on time and space complexity.

### Posteriori Testing:
1. Performed after the program is implemented, and depends on the hardware and language.
2. Measures actual performance, such as time and memory usage.

## Characteristics of an Algorithm:
1. **Input**: The algorithm accepts at least 0 or more inputs.
2. **Output**: The algorithm produces at least 1 output.
3. **Definiteness**: Each step must have a clear meaning.
4. **Finiteness**: The algorithm must have a finite number of steps.
5. **Effectiveness**: The algorithm should have a clear purpose and be feasible to implement.

## How to Analyze an Algorithm:

When analyzing an algorithm, consider the following criteria:
1. **Time**: The algorithm should be fast.
2. **Space**: It should use minimal memory.
3. **Network Consumption**: How much data is transferred.
4. **Power Consumption**: How much power the algorithm consumes.
5. **CPU Register Consumption**: Relevant for low-level programming (e.g., device drivers).

## Frequency Count Method:

This method is used to determine the time complexity of an algorithm.

## Time Complexity:

Time complexity is the measure of the time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size.

### Analysis of Control Structures:
- **If**, **While**, and **For** loops with conditional statements can affect the time complexity, leading to best and worst-case scenarios.

### Types of Time Complexity:

- **O(1)**: Constant time.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time.
- **O(n)**: Linear time.
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time.
- **O(n³)**: Cubic time.
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time.
- **O(3^n)**: Exponential time.

### Order of Time Complexities (from best to worst):

1 < log n < √n < n < n log n < n² < n³ < 2^n < 3^n < ... < n^n
