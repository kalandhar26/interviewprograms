# Object Oriented Programming Guide

## Polymorphism

- principle that allows one entity (such as a method or object) to take many forms. Polymorphism allows one interface to
  represent multiple forms. In Java, it enables flexible and reusable code by letting objects of different classes be
  treated as objects of a common superclass.

**Types of Polymorphism:**

-- *Compile Time Polymorphism / Static Binding / Early Binding* :

- Achieved through method overloading.
- Resolved at compile time.
- Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters types or counts.

-- *Run Time Polymorphism / Dynamic Binding / Late Binding* :

- Achieved through method overriding.
- Resolved at Run time.
- Subclass provides a new implementation of an inherited method.

## Encapsulation

- It is the mechanism of hiding the internal state (data) of an object and restricting direct access to it. Instead,
  access is provided through public methods (getters and setters).
- It refers to bundling data (fields) and methods (behavior) inside a class while controlling access to the internal
  state.

### Implementation

- **Data Hiding (Private Fields)** : Fields are declared *private* to prevent direct external access.
- **Public Getters & Setters and Methods** : Use public getter/setter & methods to modify private fields.
- **Records (Java 16+)** : They provide a compact way to create *immutable data classes*. Automatically private final
  fields + getters.Records can implement interfaces but cannot extend classes (support polymorphism via interfaces).
- **Sealed Classes (Java 17+) for Controlled Inheritance** : They restricts which classes can extend a parent class and
  also enhances encapsulation by limiting subclassing.Restricts which classes can extend a parent, improving
  polymorphism safety.
- **Pattern Matching (Java 21) for Safer Data Access** : It Simplifies type-checking and extraction in encapsulated
  objects. Simplifies instance checks and casting in polymorphic structures.
- **Static Factory Methods (Alternative to Constructors)** : It Encapsulates object creation logic.

## Abstraction

- Abstraction is an OOP principle that hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features. It
  helps
  in reducing complexity and improving maintainability. we can implement using abstract classes and interfaces.

-- **Abstract classes**

- Defines a template for subclasses but cannot be instantiated.
- Can have abstract methods (no body) and concrete methods.

-- **Interfaces** Java 8

- Pure abstraction before Java 8 (only method declarations).
- Now supports default, static, and private methods (Java 8+).
- Before Java 8, We need to implement the interface methods in all the implemented classes, Even for some classes some
  methods are not required also we need to implement them forcefully where maintenance problem arises.
- To fix the above issue default methods are introduced in interfaces. We can implement these method in which ever
  classes are required.
- Before Java 8, Instance variables and methods are always associated with class Object But static methods and variables
  are never associated with Class Objects. When static methods are never associated with classes why should one declare
  in classes as they are heavy weighted where as interfaces are light weight.
- Before java 9, When multiple default or static methods in an interface share common code, writing that common logic
  again and again cause code duplication. Private methods in interfaces enhance code reusability and maintainability
  within the interface itself.

-- **Records** Java 16

- Provides a compact way to define immutable data classes.
- Automatically generates equals(), hashCode(), toString().

-- **Sealed Classes** Java 17

- Restricts which classes can implement an interface
- Improves controlled abstraction

-- **Pattern Matching** Java 21

- Simplifies type-checking and extraction in abstract hierarchies.

-- **Static & Factory Methods (Alternative to Constructors)**

- Encapsulates object creation logic.

## Inheritance:

- In Java inheritance means allowing one class to acquire the properties (fields and methods) of another class.
- Superclass (Parent class): The class being inherited from.
- Subclass (Child class): The class that inherits from another class.
- extends: Keyword used to inherit from a class
- final classes cannot be inherited and final methods cannot be overridden.
- super keyword can access parent class methods and constructor chaining.

-> **Types**

- **Single Inheritance**
- **Multilevel Inheritance**
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**
- Java doesn't support **multiple inheritance** with classes to avoid the **"diamond problem"**.
- Parent class methods are by default available to child class through inheritance. If in case multiple parent class
  having same method, but when child want to access that method JVM confuses which method to execute.
- **Multiple Inheritance** at interface level is allowed. Interfaces only contain method declarations (no
  implementations).Implementation is provided solely by the implementing class.

## Is-a Relationship (Inheritance)

- An **"Is-a"** relationship represents inheritance, where one class is a specialized version of another class.

## Has-a Relationship (Composition)

- A **"Has-a"** relationship represents composition, where one class contains an instance of another class as a member.

| **Aspect**       | **Is-a Relationship**          | **Has-a Relationship**         |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Keyword**      | extends / implements           | Member variable                |
| **Relationship** | Inheritance                    | Composition / Aggregation      |
| **Flexibility**  | Less flexible (tight coupling) | More flexible (loose coupling) |
| **Reusability**  | Inherits all parent features   | Selectively uses features      |
| **Access**       | Can access protected members   | Only accesses public members   |

**Notes**

1. Prefer composition (Has-a) over inheritance (Is-a) when possible - it's more flexible and reduces coupling
2. Use inheritance only when there's a clear hierarchical relationship
3. Consider the Liskov Substitution Principle: if a subclass can't properly substitute for its parent, composition is
   likely better
4. Use interfaces to achieve polymorphism without the tight coupling of class inheritance

## Abstract Class

- Abstract classes CAN have constructors in Java, Even though they can't be instantiated directly.
- Abstract class constructors are invoked automatically when a concrete subclass is instantiated. Its part of the normal
  constructor chaining process.
- To initialize the state of the abstract class when a concrete subclass is instantiated.
- To participate in the constructor call chain when subclass objects are created.
- To provide common initialization code for all subclasses.
- Abstract classes can have constructors, they cannot be marked as abstract - constructors are always concrete
  implementations.

## Composition (Strong "has-a" Relationship)

- A strict ownership relationship where the contained object cannot exist without the container
- The contained object's lifecycle is controlled by the container
- The container directly owns the contained object
- Typically created in constructor: The container creates its parts

## Aggregation (Weak "has-a" Relationship)

- A loose ownership relationship where the contained object can exist independently.
- The container holds a reference but doesn't manage the lifecycle.
- The container uses but doesn't own the object.
- Passed via constructor/setter: External objects can be injected

### 1. Data Hiding

* **Q1: What is data hiding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**
* **A1:** Data hiding is an OOP feature where an outside person cannot directly access internal data, or internal data
  should not directly go out. It ensures that data members are typically declared as private to achieve this.
* **Q2: How is data hiding achieved in Java, and what is its main advantage?**
* **A2:** In Java, data hiding is achieved by **declaring data members as private**. The main advantage of data hiding
  is **security**. For instance, after proper validation (like providing username and password), an outside user can
  access specific internal data, such as Gmail inbox information, but not others'.

### 2. Abstraction

* **Q3: Explain the concept of Abstraction.**
* **A3:** Abstraction involves **hiding internal implementation details** and **only highlighting the set of services**
  that are being offered. An example is an ATM GUI screen, which shows customers the services available without
  revealing the internal workings of the bank's system.
* **Q4: How can abstraction be implemented in Java, and what are its advantages?**
* **A4:** Abstraction can be implemented in Java using **interfaces and abstract classes**. The main advantages of
  abstraction include:
  * Achieving **security**.
  * Enabling **easier enhancement** by allowing changes in the internal system without affecting outside customers.
  * Improving the **maintainability** of the application.
  * Improving the **easiness to use** the application.

### 3. Encapsulation

* **Q5: What is encapsulation in OOP?**
* **A5:** Encapsulation is defined as **the process of binding data and corresponding methods into a single unit**. A
  component is considered encapsulated if it follows both data hiding and abstraction. Thus, **Encapsulation = data
  hiding + abstraction**. For example, a `Student` class binds data members (like student name) and methods (like
  behaviour).
* **Q6: What are the advantages and drawbacks of encapsulation?**
* **A6:** The main advantages of encapsulation are:
  * Achieving **security**.
  * Improving the **maintainability** of the application.
* The drawbacks include:
  * It **slows down the execution**.
  * It **increases the length of the code**.

### 4. Tightly Encapsulated Class

* **Q7: When is a class said to be "tightly encapsulated"?**
* **A7:** A class is said to be **tightly encapsulated if and only if each and every variable in it is declared as
  private**. It does not matter whether the class contains corresponding getter and setter methods or whether these
  methods are public.
* **Q8: How does the encapsulation status of a parent class affect its child classes?**
* **A8:** If a parent class is **not tightly encapsulated**, then its following child classes are also considered **not
  tightly encapsulated**, even if the child classes themselves have all private variables.

### 5. Is a Relationship (Inheritance)

* **Q9: What is "Is a Relationship" in Java, and what is its primary advantage?**
* **A9:** "Is a Relationship" is also known as **Inheritance**. It is implemented using the `extends` keyword. The
  biggest advantage of inheritance is **reusability**.
* **Q10: Explain the validity of Parent reference and Child Object creation versus Child reference and Parent Object
  creation.**
* **A10:**
  *   **Parent reference and Child Object creation is valid** (e.g., `Parent p = new Child();`). However, using the
  parent reference, you **cannot access child-specific methods**. This approach is useful when the exact runtime type of
  the object is unknown, allowing the parent reference to hold any child class object.
  *   **Child reference and Parent Object creation is invalid** (e.g., `Child c = new Parent();`).
* **Q11: How is the Java API structured based on inheritance, and what is the role of the `Object` class?**
* **A11:** The Java API is **implemented based on Inheritance**. The **`Object` class is the root for all Java classes
  **. The most common methods applicable to any object are defined in the `Object` class, making them available by
  default to every Java class without rewriting. Every class in Java is a child class of `Object`, either directly or
  indirectly.
* **Q12: Why does Java not support multiple inheritance with respect to classes, but it does with interfaces?**
* **A12:**
  *   **Classes:** Java does not support multiple inheritance with respect to classes (a class cannot extend more than
  one class at a time) because there is a chance of an **ambiguity problem**.
  *   **Interfaces:** Java supports multiple inheritance with respect to interfaces. This is because even when an
  interface extends multiple interfaces, only **declarations are available in parent interfaces**, and the *
  *implementation is done in the child class**. Therefore, there is **no chance of an ambiguity problem** with
  interfaces.

### 6. Has a Relationship

* **Q13: What is "Has a Relationship," and how is it implemented? What is its main advantage?**
* **A13:** "Has a Relationship" is also known as **composition and aggregation**. There is no specific keyword for its
  implementation, but often the `new` keyword is used. The main advantage of "Has a Relationship" is **reusability of
  the code**.
* **Q14: Differentiate between composition and aggregation.**
* **A14:**
  *   **Composition:** Represents a **strong association** between container and contained objects. If the container
  object does not exist, there is no chance of the contained object existing. For example, a university contains
  departments; without the university, departments cannot exist. In composition, the container object holds contained
  objects directly.
  *   **Aggregation:** Represents a **weak association** between container and contained objects. There is a chance of
  the contained object existing even without the container object. For example, a department contains professors; if the
  department closes, professors might be transferred to other departments. In aggregation, the container object holds
  references to contained objects.
* **Q15: When should one choose an "Is a" relationship versus a "Has a" relationship?**
* **A15:**
  * If you need the **total functionality of a class**, you should go for an **"Is a" relationship** (inheritance). For
  example, a `Student` class requires the complete functionality of a `Person` class.
  * If you need **part of the functionality** of a class, you should go for a **"Has a" relationship** (
  composition/aggregation). For example, `Class Demo` requires partial functionality from `Test Class`.

### 7. Method Signature

* **Q16: What elements constitute a method signature in Java? What is not included?**
* **A16:** In Java, a method signature consists of the **method name followed by argument types**, and the **order of
  arguments is also part of the signature**. For example, `method(int i, float f)`.
* **Return type is not part of the method signature** in Java. **Modifiers are also not part of the method signature**.
  Within a class, two methods with the same signature are not allowed.

### 8. Overloading

* **Q17: What is method overloading? How is method resolution handled in overloading?**
* **A17:** Method overloading occurs when two methods have the **same name but different argument types or different
  numbers of arguments**.
* In overloading, **method resolution is handled by the compiler based on the reference type**. Hence, overloading is
  also known as **compile-time polymorphism, static polymorphism, or early binding**.
* **Q18: Explain automatic promotion in method overloading.**
* **A18:** When resolving overloaded methods, if an exact matched method is not available, the compiler first **promotes
  the argument to the next level** (e.g., `char` to `int`) and checks for a matched method. This process continues
  through possible promotions until a match is found. If no match is found after all possible promotions, a compile-time
  error occurs.
* The promotion hierarchy for primitive types is: `char -> int -> long -> float -> double` and
  `byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double`. For objects: `String -> Object` and `StringBuffer -> Object`.
* **Q19: What priority does a var-arg method receive in method overloading?**
* **A19:** In general, a var-arg method receives the **least priority**. It will only be considered if no other matched
  method is available, similar to a default case in a switch statement.

### 9. Overriding

* **Q20: What is method overriding? How is method resolution handled?**
* **A20:** Method overriding is when a child class re-implements a method (that it inherited from its parent) because it
  is not satisfied with the parent class's implementation. The parent class method is called the Overridden method, and
  the child class method is called the Overriding method.
* In overriding, **method resolution is always handled by the JVM based on the runtime object**. Hence, overriding is
  also considered **run-time polymorphism, dynamic polymorphism, or late binding**.
* **Q21: Explain the concept of covariant return types in method overriding.**
* **A21:** Prior to Java 1.5, return types in overriding had to be strictly identical. From Java 1.5 onwards, *
  *covariant return types are allowed**, meaning the child class method's return type can be a **sub-type of the parent
  method's return type**. This concept applies only to **object types**, not to primitive types. For example, if a
  parent method returns `Object`, the child method can return `Object`, `String`, or `StringBuffer`.
* **Q22: List the key rules for method overriding.**
* **A22:**
  * Method names and argument types (i.e., **method signatures**) must be the same in both parent and child classes.
  * Return types should be the same, but **covariant return types are allowed** from Java 1.5.
  * Overriding **is not applicable to private methods** because they are not available to the child class.
  * If a parent class method is `final`, the child class **cannot override** it.
  * If a parent class method is `abstract`, it is **mandatory to override** it in the child class (unless the child
  class is also abstract).
  * A non-abstract method can be overridden as abstract to stop its implementation from being available to further child
  classes.
  * When overriding, the **scope of the access modifier cannot be reduced** but can be increased (e.g., `default` to
  `protected` or `public` is correct, but `public` to `private` is wrong).
  * If a child class method throws a checked exception, the parent class method **must throw the same checked exception
  or its parent exception**, otherwise, a compile-time error occurs. There are no such restrictions for unchecked
  exceptions.
* **Q23: What is method hiding, and how does it relate to static methods and overriding?**
* **A23:** Method hiding applies when **both parent and child class methods are static**, have the same signature, and
  thus appear to be overridden. However, it is **not true overriding**. In method hiding, **method resolution is handled
  by the compiler based on the reference type**.
* Key differences from overriding:
  *   **Method Hiding:** Both methods must be `static`. Compiler is responsible for method resolution based on reference
  type. It's compile-time polymorphism/static polymorphism/early binding. Old data is available, so the parent method
  can be executed with a parent reference.
  *   **Method Overriding:** Both methods must be non-static. JVM is responsible for method resolution based on the
  runtime object. It's run-time polymorphism/dynamic polymorphism/late binding. Old data is not available; it considers
  the child method based on the object during runtime.
* **Q24: Is overriding applicable to variables?**
* **A24:** **Overriding is not applicable to variables**. Variable resolution is always handled by the compiler based on
  the reference type, regardless of whether the variable is static or non-static. Overriding concepts apply only to
  methods.

### 10. Static Control Flow

* **Q25: Describe the sequence of steps in static control flow when a Java class is executed.**
* **A25:** When a Java class is executed, the following sequence of steps occurs as part of static control flow:
  1.  **Identification of static members** from top to bottom. JVM assigns default values for static members.
  2.  **Execution of static variable assignments and static blocks** from top to bottom. JVM executes static blocks and
  assigns original values to static members.
  3.  **Execution of the `main` method**.
* **Q26: Explain "direct read" and "indirect read" in static blocks and the "RIWO" state.**
* **A26:**
  *   **Direct Read:** Reading a variable directly inside a static block.
  *   **Indirect Read:** Calling a method from within a static block, and then reading a variable inside that method.
  *   **RIWO (Read-Indirectly and Write-Only) State:** If a static variable has been identified by the JVM but its
  original value has not yet been assigned, it is in an RIWO state. In this state, a **direct read will result in a
  compile-time error** (Illegal forward reference), but an **indirect read is permissible**.
* **Q27: When are static blocks executed, and for what purposes are they used?**
* **A27:** Static blocks are executed **at the time of class loading**. They are used to perform any activity required
  during class loading. Examples include loading corresponding native libraries or registering database driver classes (
  which often have internal static blocks for this purpose). Any number of static blocks can be declared within a class,
  and they are executed from top to bottom.
* **Q28: From Java 1.7 onwards, is it possible to print statements to the console without a `main` method?**
* **A28:** **No**. While it was previously possible using static blocks, from Java 1.7 versions onwards, the `main`
  method is **mandatory** to start program execution. Therefore, it is impossible to print statements to the console
  without a `main` method.

### 11. Instance Control Flow

* **Q29: What are instance members, and when does instance control flow execute?**
* **A29:** Instance members are **object-level members**, meaning it is mandatory to create an object to access them.
  Instance control flow executes **whenever an object is created** (after the static control flow has completed and an
  object is instantiated within it).
* **Q30: Describe the sequence of steps in instance control flow.**
* **A30:** When an object is created, the following steps are executed as part of instance control flow:
  1.  **Identification of instance members** from top to bottom.
  2.  **Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks** from top to bottom.
  3.  **Execution of the constructor**.
* These three steps are repeated for every object created; if 100 objects are created, these steps will execute 100
  times.
* **Q31: Why is object creation considered costly, and when should one avoid creating objects?**
* **A31:** Object creation is considered a **costly operation**. Performance can be low if unwanted objects are created.
  Therefore, it is **not recommended to create an object unless there is a specific requirement to use it**.
* **Q32: List the different ways to create an object in Java.**
* **A32:** An object can be created in Java using:
  1. The `new` operator.
  2. The `newInstance()` method.
  3. Factory methods.
  4. The `clone()` method.
  5. Deserialization.

### 12. Constructors

* **Q33: What is the main purpose of a constructor in Java? Why are they used for initialization?**
* **A33:** The main purpose of a constructor is to **perform initialization of an object**, not to create the object
  itself. Constructors are preferred for initialization because they streamline the process; without them, values would
  need to be initialized for every object individually, which reduces readability and increases code length, especially
  for many objects.
* **Q34: Compare and contrast constructors and instance blocks regarding object initialization.**
* **A34:**
  *   **Purpose:** The main purpose of a constructor is object initialization. Instance blocks are used for activities
  *other than* initialization that need to be performed for every object creation, such as updating a database entry or
  incrementing a count.
  *   **Execution Order:** Both constructors and instance blocks are executed for every object creation. However, the *
  *instance block executes first, followed by the constructor**.
* **Q35: What happens if a return type is declared for a constructor?**
* **A35:** If a return type is mistakenly declared for a constructor, **no compile-time error will occur** because the
  compiler treats it as a regular method. While it is syntactically valid to name a method with the class name, it is
  considered **worst programming practice**.
* **Q36: What are the key rules for constructors in Java?**
* **A36:**
  * The **name of the class and the name of the constructor must match**.
  * The **return type concept is not applicable** to constructors.
  *   `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `default` modifiers are allowed. Other modifiers are not allowed.
* **Q37: Describe the characteristics of a default constructor.**
* **A37:**
  * The **compiler is responsible for defining a default constructor** if no constructor is explicitly defined by the
  programmer. If a programmer defines any constructor, the compiler will not generate one.
  * Every class in Java has a constructor, either default (compiler-generated) or customized (programmer-generated), but
  not both simultaneously.
  * A default constructor is **always a no-argument constructor**.
  * Its **access modifier is the same as the class access modifier** (applicable for `public` and `default`).
  * It contains only one line: `super();`, which is a no-argument call to the superclass constructor.
* **Q38: Explain the rules for `super()` and `this()` calls within constructors.**
* **A38:**
  *   `super()` or `this()` **must be the first statement** in a constructor.
  * Only **one** of `super()` or `this()` can be used, not both simultaneously.
  * They can only be used **inside a constructor**. Trying to use them outside a constructor will result in a
  compile-time error. This means a constructor can only be called directly from another constructor.
* **Q39: Are inheritance and overriding concepts applicable to constructors? What about overloading?**
* **A39:** **Inheritance and overriding concepts are not applicable to constructors**. However, **constructor
  overloading is available**.
* **Q40: Can abstract classes and interfaces have constructors?**
* **A40:** **Every class in Java, including abstract classes, can contain constructors**. However, **interfaces cannot
  contain constructors**.
* **Q41: When is it impossible to create child classes for a given class?**
* **A41:** It is impossible to create child classes for a class in two scenarios:
  1. When the class is declared as `final`.
  2. When the class has **all its constructors declared as private**.

### 13. Coupling

* **Q42: What is coupling in software development? Differentiate between tightly and loosely coupled components.**
* **A42:** Coupling refers to the **degree of dependency between components**.
* **Tightly Coupled:** If the dependency between components is high. This is considered **not a good programming
  practice** as it has several disadvantages, such as making enhancement difficult (modifying one component affects
  others), suppressing reusability, and reducing maintainability.
* **Loosely Coupled:** If the dependency between components is low. This is considered **good programming practice**, as
  it makes enhancement easier, enhances reusability, and increases maintainability. The goal is to maintain dependency
  as low as possible.

### 14. Cohesion

* **Q43: What is cohesion in software development? Why is high cohesion preferred?**
* **A43:** Cohesion means that for every component, a **clear, well-defined functionality is defined**.
* **High Cohesion** is considered a **good programming practice**. It means that a component is focused on a single,
  well-defined task. This allows for modifications to a component without affecting others, makes enhancement easier,
  enhances reusability, and increases application maintainability.
* **Low Cohesion** is considered a bad programming practice.
* The **best combination for good programming practice is loosely coupling and high cohesion**.

### 15. Type-Casting

* **Q44: What is Object Typecasting in Java? Explain the three checks involved.**
* **A44:** Object typecasting allows for providing an existing object with **another type of reference variable**. It
  does not create a new object but rather changes the reference type.
* There are three checks involved in typecasting:
  1.  **Compiler Check 1:** The type of the variable being cast (`y`) and the target type (`B`) must have **some
  relation** (Child to Parent, Parent to Child, or Same Type). Otherwise, a compile-time error "Inconvertible types"
  occurs.
  2.  **Compiler Check 2:** The target type (`B`) must be **either the same as or a derived type (child class) of the
  original reference type** (`A`). Otherwise, a compile-time error "Found B Required A" occurs.
  3.  **JVM Runtime Check:** The **runtime object type of the variable (`y`) must be either the same as or a derived
  type of the target type (`B`)**. Otherwise, a `ClassCastException` runtime error occurs.
* **Q45: How does typecasting interact with method overriding, method hiding, and variables?**
* **A45:**
  *   **Method Overriding:** If typecasting is involved with methods that are overridden, **method resolution is always
  based on the runtime object type**.
  *   **Method Hiding:** If typecasting is involved with methods that are hidden (static methods with the same signature
  in parent and child), **method resolution is always based on the reference type**.
  *   **Variables:** Variable resolution is **always based on the reference type**, not on the runtime object,
  regardless of typecasting.
