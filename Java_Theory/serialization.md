**1. Does the static variables takes part in serialization?**

- No, static variables do not take part in serialization in Java.
- serialization involves saving the state of an object's instance variables, which are tied to the object itself.
- Static variables, however, are associated with the class rather than any specific object instance.
- Instance variables: Serialized, as they represent the state of the object.
- Static variables: Not serialized, as they belong to the class and not the object.

**2. What is Serialization?**

- Serialization is the process of converting a Java object (in its Java-supported form) into a format that can be stored
  in a file or transmitted over a network, such as a byte stream. This allows the object's state to be saved or sent to
  another system.

**3. What is Deserialization?**

- Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization. It involves converting a file-supported or network-supported
  form (e.g., a byte stream) back into a Java object, restoring its state in a Java-supported form.

**4. What is the Transient Keyword?**

- The transient keyword in Java is used to mark instance variables that should not be serialized during the
  serialization
  process. When an object is serialized, transient variables are excluded and are assigned their default values (e.g.,
  null for objects, 0 for numeric types) during deserialization.

**5. What is an Object Graph?**

- An object graph refers to the set of all objects that are reachable from a given object during serialization. When a
  Java object is serialized, all objects referenced by it (directly or indirectly) are also serialized automatically,
  forming the object graph. This ensures the entire state of the object, including its dependencies, is preserved.

**6. How to Implement Customized Serialization?**

- Customized serialization is used to control the serialization process, especially to handle cases where information
  might be lost due to the transient keyword or other requirements.

```java
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream oos) throws Exception {
    oos.defaultWriteObject(); // Perform default serialization
    // Add custom logic, e.g., serialize a transient field
}
```

**7. How to Implement Customized Deserialization?**

- Customized deserialization allows you to control how an object is reconstructed during deserialization.

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream ois) throws Exception {
    ois.defaultReadObject(); // Perform default deserialization
    // Add custom logic, e.g., restore a transient field
}
```

**8. What are Callback Methods?**

- Callback methods are methods that are automatically executed by the JVM at specific points during a programâ€™s
  lifecycle. In the context of serialization, the following are examples of callback methods:

- main(String[] args): Executed when a Java program starts.
- writeObject(ObjectOutputStream oos): Executed during serialization.
- readObject(ObjectInputStream ois): Executed during deserialization.
- These methods are called "callback" because they are invoked by the JVM without explicit calls from the programmer.
