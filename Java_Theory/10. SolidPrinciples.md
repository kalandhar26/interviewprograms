## S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- A class should have only one reason to change.
- A class should have only one job or responsibility. If a class is handling multiple things (e.g., business logic and
  database operations), changes in one concern may affect the other.
- Promotes modularity.
- Makes code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

## O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- You should be able to add new functionality without modifying existing code, usually by relying on abstraction (
  interfaces or base classes).
- Promotes extensibility without breaking existing functionality.
- Makes systems easier to maintain and scale.

## L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- A subclass should honor the contract defined by the base class. You should be able to replace a parent class with a
  subclass and the behavior should remain consistent.
- Prevents unexpected behavior.
- Ensures polymorphism works correctly.

## I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific interfaces so that implementing classes only need to define methods
  they actually use.
- Improves code clarity and cohesion.
- Reduces the chance of unused or dummy method implementations.

## D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- Instead of tightly coupling classes to concrete implementations, depend on interfaces. This encourages loose coupling
  and makes your system more flexible and testable.
