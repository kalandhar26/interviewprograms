## Stack Introduction

- Just like arrays and linked lists, a stack is a linear data structure that is used for storing data.
- Insertion and Deletion only happen at the top of the stack. (Last In First Out)

## Implementation of Stack

- Fixed size array
- Dynamic Array
- Linked List

→ Stack that uses a fixed size array
→ Stack that is dynamic array (LinkedList or ArrayList)
## Features of Stack

- Stacks differ from the arrays in a way that in arrays random access is possible, this means that we cab access any
  element just by using its index in the array. Where as, in a stack only limited access is possible and only the top is
  directly available.
- Stacks are generally dynamic in nature; this means that they do not have a fixed size and their size can be increased
  or decreased depending upon the number of elements.

## Stack Operations
- push(x) - add element
- pop() - remove element
- peek() - get element
