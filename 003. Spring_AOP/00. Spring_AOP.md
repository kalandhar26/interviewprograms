## Explain the concept of AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) in Java?

- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the
  separation of cross-cutting concerns.
- It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead
  separately specifying which code is modified via a “pointcut” specification.
- This means that behaviors that cut across many parts of an application, such as logging, transaction management, or
  security, can be modularized into distinct aspects rather than spread throughout the code.

- In simple way we can also explain AOP as AOP is a way in Java to separate repeated tasks (like logging, security
  checks, or transaction handling) from your main business logic.
- It helps you avoid writing the same code in multiple places and instead, you define it once and apply it where needed
  automatically. That’s how AOP works — you define common functionality once and it gets automatically inserted wherever
  needed in your app.

## How can you use AOP frameworks like AspectJ or Spring AOP?

| **Term**       | **Simple Meaning**                                                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aspect**     | The common functionality you want to apply (e.g., logging, security, transactions)   |
| **Join Point** | A point in the program where extra code can be added (before/after method execution) |
| **Pointcut**   | A rule that selects which methods or classes should get the aspect                   |
| **Advice**     | The actual code that runs (what happens before, after, or around a method)           |
| **Weaving**    | The process of adding the advice into the main code (compile-time or runtime)        |
