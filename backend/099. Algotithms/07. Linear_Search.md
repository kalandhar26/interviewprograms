# Linear Search
- Linear Search (also known as Sequential Search) is a simple algorithm used to find a target element in a list or array. It works by sequentially checking each element of the array from the beginning to the end until the target is found or the end of the array is reached. If the element is not found, it returns an indication.

## Key Characteristics:
- Best Case: O(1) – Target is at the first position.
- Worst Case: O(n) – Target is at the last position or not present (where n is the array size).
- Average Case: O(n).
- Space Complexity: O(1) – No extra space needed beyond the input array.
- Pros: Simple to implement; works on unsorted data; no preprocessing required.
- Cons: Inefficient for large datasets (better alternatives like Binary Search exist for sorted data).

## How It Works (Step-by-Step):
- Start from the first element of the array (index 0).
- Compare the current element with the target value.
- If they match, return the index of the current element.
- If not, move to the next element (increment index).
- Repeat until the end of the array or the target is found.
- If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 (or a message indicating "not found").


```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class LinearSearch {
    
    // Method to perform linear search
    public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        // Loop through each element starting from index 0
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            // If current element matches target, return its index
            if (arr[i] == target) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        // If not found after checking all elements, return -1
        return -1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example array (unsorted)
        int[] numbers = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        int target = 22;  // Element to search for
        
        // Perform the search
        int result = linearSearch(numbers, target);
        
        // Print the array for reference
        System.out.println("Array: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));
        
        // Output the result
        if (result != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element " + target + " found at index " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element " + target + " not found in the array.");
        }
    }
}
```

- output

```text
Array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Element 22 found at index 4 
```
