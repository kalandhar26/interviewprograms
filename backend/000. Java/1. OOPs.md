### 1. Method Overloading

- Method Overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (
  different type, number, or both). It helps in increasing the readability of the program.

```java
class Overloading {

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display method");
    }

    void display(int a) {
        System.out.println("Display method with int parameter");
    }

    void display(String a) {
        System.out.println("Display method with String parameter");
    }
}
```

### 2. Method Overriding

- Method Overriding occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name and parameters as a method in its superclass.
- In overriding, the method in the subclass is used instead of the one in the superclass, allowing for dynamic method
  dispatch and polymorphism.

```java
// Method Overriding
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Cat eats fish.");
    }
}
//eat() method overridden
```

### 3. Method Hiding

- Method Hiding occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same name and method signature as a static
  method in its superclass.
- The method to be executed is decided at compile time, based on the reference type, not the object type. Unlike method
  overriding, method hiding does not support runtime polymorphism.

```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent static show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Child static show()");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Parent();
        Parent c = new Child();
        Child ch = new Child();

        p.show();   // Parent static show()
        c.show();   // Parent static show()
        ch.show();  // Child static show()
    }
}

```

### What is Polymorphism?

- Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It lets us perform a single action in
  different ways. Java supports polymorphism through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (
  compile-time polymorphism).

```java
class Bird {
    void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird flies.");
    }
}

class Parrot extends Bird {
    void fly() {
        System.out.println("Parrot is flying.");
    }
}
```

### 1. What is OOPS?

- OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System (commonly called Object-Oriented Programming – OOP).
- It is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, rather than functions or procedures.

#### Core Idea

- An object combines:
- Data (State) → variables
- Behavior → methods
- Objects interact with each other to build applications.

#### Why OOPS?

- Mimics real-world modeling
- Makes code:
- Modular
- Reusable
- Easy to maintain
- Scalable for large applications

#### In a banking application:

- BankAccount is a class
- balance is data
- withdraw() is behavior

```java
class BankAccount {
    double balance;

    void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

### 2. What are the Four Pillars of OOPS?

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- These principles work together to build robust, flexible, and secure applications.

### 3. Difference Between Class and Object

- Aspect Class Object
- Definition Blueprint or template Real instance of class
- Memory No memory allocated Occupies memory
- Nature Logical Physical
- Creation Defined once Can create multiple
- Example class Car {} Car c = new Car();

### Analogy

- Class → Cookie cutter
- Object → Actual cookie 🍪

### 4. What is Encapsulation?

- Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to
  the data.

#### Why Encapsulation?

- Data hiding
- Better security
- Controlled access
- Easy maintenance

#### Example

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

}
```

- Here, balance cannot be accessed directly.

### 5. How is Encapsulation Achieved in Java?

- Private fields
- Public getters and setters
- Access modifiers

```java
public void setBalance(double amount) {
    if (amount >= 0) {
        balance = amount;
    }
}
```

### 6. What is Abstraction?

- Abstraction means hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.
- Focus

### What to do

- Not how it is done

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}
```

- User only knows draw() exists — not how it is implemented.

### 7. Abstract Class vs Interface

- Feature Abstract Class Interface
- Variables Instance variables allowed Only constants
- Constructors Yes No
- Inheritance Single Multiple
- Methods Abstract + concrete Abstract, default, static

#### Use Case

- Abstract class → Base functionality
- Interface → Capability / contract

### 8. Can an Interface Have Method Implementation?

- Yes (Java 8+)

#### Types

- Default methods
- Static methods

```
interface Vehicle {
default void start() {
System.out.println("Engine started");
}

    static void honk() {
        System.out.println("Beep");
    }

}
```

### 9. What is Inheritance?

- Inheritance allows a child class to acquire properties and behavior of a parent class using extends.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
    }
}
```

#### Benefits

- Code reuse
- Logical hierarchy

### 10. Types of Inheritance in Java

#### Supported:

- Single
- Multilevel
- Hierarchical
- Multiple (via classes)❌ Not supported:
- ✔ Achieved using interfaces

### 11. What is Polymorphism?

- Polymorphism means one interface, multiple implementations.

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.

sound();
```

#### Types

- Compile-time
- Runtime

### 12. Compile-Time vs Runtime Polymorphism

- Aspect Compile-Time Runtime
- Mechanism Method overloading Method overriding
- Binding Static Dynamic
- Decision Compile time Runtime

### 13. What is Method Overloading?

- Same method name, different parameters.
- int add(int a, int b);
- double add(double a, double b);

### 14. What is Method Overriding?

- Child class provides its own implementation of parent method.

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

### 15. Rules for Overriding

- Same method signature
- Access level cannot be reduced
- Covariant return allowed
- Cannot override static/final/private methods

### 16. What is super Keyword?

- Refers to parent class object.
- super.method();
- super();

### 17. What is this Keyword?

- Refers to current object.
- this.name = name;

### 18. Can Constructor Be Overridden?

- ❌ No
- Constructors are not inherited.

### 19. Can Constructor Be Overloaded?

- ✅ Yes

```java
Dog() {
}

Dog(String name) {
}
```

### 20. What is Association?

- A HAS-A relationship between objects.

```java
class Student {
    Course course;
}

```

### 21. Aggregation vs Composition

- Aspect Aggregation Composition
- Relationship Weak Strong
- Lifecycle Independent Dependent
- Example Car → Wheel House → Room

### 22. What is Dynamic Binding?

- Method call resolved at runtime.

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.

sound();
```

### 23. What is Static Binding?

- Resolved at compile time.
- Overloading
- Static methods

### 24. What is Marker Interface?

- Interface with no methods.
- Examples: Serializable, Cloneable

### 25. Why Java Doesn’t Support Multiple Inheritance?

- To avoid Diamond Problem and ambiguity.

### 26. What is Diamond Problem?

- When two parent classes have the same method, child becomes confused.
- Java avoids it using:
- Single inheritance
- Multiple interfaces

### 27. Can We Override Static Methods?

- ❌ No
- Static methods are hidden, not overridden.

### 28. What is Object Cloning?

- Creating an exact copy using clone().

```java

class Employee implements Cloneable {
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

### 29. What is Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy?

| Aspect     | Shallow Copy   | Deep Copy       |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Copies     | References     | Actual objects  |
| Dependency | Shared         | Independent     |
| Use        | Simple objects | Complex objects |

### 30. Why is OOPS Important?

- Reusability
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Security
- Real-world modeling
