## What Was the Project About?

I worked on a project called "Swap Trade Reporting" for about 3 months. The main goal was to handle and send reports
about special financial deals called "derivative trades." These reports had to follow strict rules from governments
around the world to make sure everything was fair and legal.

## What Kinds of Deals Did It Handle?

- *The app dealt with different types of financial products, like:*

- *Fixed Income:* Loans or bonds that pay steady interest.
- *Interest Rate Derivatives:* Bets on how interest rates will change.
- *Credit Derivatives:* Bets on whether companies or people will pay back loans.
- *FX (Foreign Exchange) Derivatives:* Bets on currency value changes, like dollars vs. euros.
- *Commodity Derivatives:* Bets on prices of things like oil, gold, or wheat.

- *These reports followed big rules like:*

- *MiFID II:* Strict European laws for trading transparency.
- *APAC Regulations:* Similar rules for countries in Asia and the Pacific area.

## How Did the App Work? (Step by Step)

### Getting the Trades: Trade info came into an internal tool called "1STR."

- *What 1STR Did:*
- Added extra details, like official rules or reference info (data enrichment).
- Changed the trade data to fit exact formats needed for regulations (transformation).
- Checked everything for errors and made it standard (validation and normalization).

- Sending It Out: Once ready, the info was sent to a "Solace Queue" (like a fast mailbox).
- From there, it went to other systems or directly to regulators.

- The whole setup was "event-driven," meaning it reacted quickly to new trades, handling tons of them without delays. It
  had tight deadlines (SLAs) to keep things speedy and reliable.

## How Did Messaging and Connections Work?

- *Solace Queue:* This was the key tool for sending messages. It made sure:
- Lots of info could flow fast (high throughput).
- No waiting around (low latency).
- Messages didn't get lost (reliable delivery).
- It was built for real-time updates on trades.

## Testing the App

- I did a lot of testing using "Cucumber," a tool that makes tests easy to read like stories.

- Wrote simple "feature files" in a language called Gherkin (like "When I do this, then that happens").
- Built the behind-the-scenes code (step definitions) to check if trades flowed right.
- Tested the adding details, changing data, and sending messages parts.
- This helped make sure the whole process worked end-to-end for real regulatory reports.

## What I Learned

- Got a deep dive into how stock markets and reporting rules work.
- Hands-on with fast messaging systems for live data.
- Practiced changing and improving data, plus story-based testing (BDD).
- Picked up the tricky details of rules in Europe (MiFID II) and Asia-Pacific areas.

### In short, it was a cool project blending finance rules, quick data handling, and solid testing to keep trades reported safely and on time!
