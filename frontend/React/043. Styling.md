# Styled Components

- Imagine your clothes stitched together with your body 👕. You never lose them, and they fit perfectly.
- Styled Components tie styles directly to components.
- Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS library that allows writing actual CSS inside JavaScript, scoped to components.

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
`;
```

# Tailwind CSS

- Imagine LEGO blocks 🧱. Instead of painting later, you build with colors already attached.
- Tailwind gives utility classes.
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level classes to build designs directly in markup.

<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2">

# Emotion

- Emotion is Styled Components’ faster cousin 🏃‍♂️. Same idea, more flexibility.

  theming.

```jsx
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
import { css } from "@emotion/react";

<div css={css`color: hotpink;`} />
```

# CSS Modules

- Imagine each child has their own locker. No one can touch another’s stuff.
- CSS Modules avoid class name conflicts.
- CSS Modules scope CSS locally by default, preventing global namespace collisions.

```css
/* styles.module.css */
.button {
  color: red;
}
```

```jsx
import styles from "./styles.module.css";

<button className={styles.button} />
```
