# 1. What is react?

- React is a library for building user interfaces.
- React is component based architecture. Reusable UI components.
- React is not a framework.
-

| Framework        | Library          |
|------------------|------------------|
| Full Solution    | Focused Solution |
| Angular, Vue     | React            |
| More Opinionated | More flexible    |
| Built-in Router  | Customized (Own) |

# What is JSX?

- JSX Means HTML written in JavaScript.
- We can write JavaScript inside HTML in script tags.

```jsx
// What you write
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

// What React compiles
const elementEquivalent = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
```

## JSX Rules?

- There are some rules to follow while writing JSX.

1. All JSX elements must be wrapped in a single parent element.

```javascript
// WRONG CODE
return(
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Content</p>
)
```

- We cannot return multiple elements without wrapping them in a parent element.

```javascript
// CORRECT
return(
    <div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Content</p>
    </div>
)
```

- Inside a div with id "root" there will be another div tag with null.

```javascript
// ALSO CORRECT (FRAGMENTS)
return(
    <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Content</p>
    </>
)
```

- Directly inside the root we have these elements.
- With fragments, we can return multiple elements without wrapping them in a parent element.
- When we use fragment, this fragment is not rendered in the DOM.

## How does React Works?

- Index.html is what we see in the browser. It loads CSS and JS files.
- In a React application, main.jsx

2. JSX elements can only be nested inside JSX elements.
3. JSX elements should use *className* instead of *class*.

```jsx
// HTML
<div class="container">
  <label for="email">Email</label>
</div>


// JSX
<div className="container">
  <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
</div>
```

4. All tags in JSX must be closed.

```jsx
// HTML STYLE (NOT ALLOWED)
<img src="photo.jpg">
<input type="text">
<br>

// JSX STYLE
<img src="photo.jpg" />
<input type="text" />
<br />
```

5. We can write JavaScript inside JSX using curly braces.

```jsx
 const name = "John";
 const items = [1,2,3,4];
 
 return (
    <div>
    <h1>Hello {name}.!</h1>
    <p>Sum: {2+2}</p>
    <p>Items: {items.length}</p>
    <p>Today: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
    </div>
 );
```

6. We can write Inline Styles should use camelCase.

```jsx
const styles = {
    color: "red",
    fontSize: "16px"
};

return (
    <div style={styles}>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
)
```

## What is Virtual DOM?

- Virtual DOM is a React Super Power that makes React so fast.
- The problem with normal rendering or with the library that has to refresh the UI is that when we work with browser and
  javascript. It is single threaded, everything we wanted to do is happening on same thread. When we wanted to do heavy
  work, it blocks the UI thread, and the UI becomes slow or unresponsive.

```javascript
// Traditional DOM Manipulation
for(let i=0;i<1000;i++){
    document.getElementById("item-${i}").textContent = `value ${i}`;
}
// 1000 DOM Operations = (Insane)
```

- Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
- When we want to update UI, What React does is it creates a new copy of Virtual DOM and then compares it with the
  previous copy of Virtual DOM. And it finds the differences which is diff phase (Diffing algorithm) and then updates
  only those differences in the actual DOM.
- This process of creating a new copy of Virtual DOM, comparing it with the previous copy, finding the differences, and
  updating only those differences in the actual DOM is called *Reconciliation*.
- Reconciliation
  Process - [ state change -> New Virtual DOM Created -> Diff with Previous DOM -> Calculates Minimum Updates -> Batch update Real DOM]

## Why Keys Matter in Lists?

- If we have a bunch of list items on the UI, React has to know which one is changed. If it does not know then it has to
  rerender all the items or everything.
- It has to delete all items from the DOM and It would have to re-add them again.
- This is where keys come into play.

```javascript
// Without Keys -> Inefficient
<ul>
    {items.map{item -> {
    <li>{item.name}</li>
    }}}
</ul>

// With Keys -> Optimized
<ul>
     {items.map{item -> {
    <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
    }}}
</ul>
```

## Components 
- Components are the building blocks of react.
- There are two types of components Functional components (MODERN WAY) and Class Components (LEGACY)

```jsx
// Function Declaration
function Welcome({name}) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

// Arrow Function
const WelcomeArrow = ({name}) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Welcome name="Alice" />
<WelcomeArrow name="Bob" />
```
