# Redux

- Imagine a bank locker 🏦. Everyone (components) cannot keep money (state) at home.
- They must: Request changes, Go through rules, Store money in one central locker
- That locker is Redux Store.

## Professional Definition

- Redux is a predictable state management library that stores application state in a single immutable store, updated via
  actions and reducers.

```jsx
const reducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  if (action.type === "INC") {
    return { count: state.count + 1 };
  }
  return state;
};
```

# Mobx

- Imagine a magic whiteboard ✨. The moment you write something, everyone sees it change automatically.
- No rules, no permission slips.
- MobX is a reactive state management library that automatically tracks dependencies and updates UI when observable
  state changes.

```jsx
import { makeAutoObservable } from "mobx";

class CounterStore {
  count = 0;
  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this);
  }
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```

# Recoil

- Imagine many small lockers 🧺 instead of one big locker.
- Each child uses only what they need. 👉 That’s Recoil atoms.
- Recoil is a state management library for React that uses atoms and selectors to manage shared state in a more modular
  and scalable way.

```jsx
import { atom } from "recoil";

const countState = atom({
  key: "count",
  default: 0
});
```

# ApolloClient (GraphQL)

- Instead of ordering full meals, you ask the chef:
- “Give me only rice and curry 🍛”
- Apollo fetches exact data needed.
- Apollo Client is a GraphQL client for managing remote server state, caching, and querying data efficiently in frontend
  applications.

```jsx
useQuery(gql`
  query {
    users {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`);
```

# ReactQuery

- Imagine a smart waiter 🍽️. If you already ordered food recently, he says:
- “No need again, I remember it.” 👉 That’s caching.
- React Query is a server-state management library that handles data fetching, caching, synchronization, and background
  updates automatically.

```jsx
useQuery({
  queryKey: ["users"],
  queryFn: fetchUsers
});
```

|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Redux       | Client state | Large apps     |
| MobX        | Client state | Fast dev       |
| Recoil      | Client state | React only     |
| Apollo      | Server state | GraphQL        |
| React Query | Server state | REST / GraphQL |

| Library              | When to Use                    | Size   | Learning Curve |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------|----------------|
| Context + useReducer | Small apps, theme, auth        | 0 kB   | Easy           |
| Zustand              | Most apps, simple global state | ~1 kB  | Easy           |
| Redux Toolkit        | Large apps, complex state      | ~10 kB | Medium         |
| Recoil               | Complex derived state          | ~15 kB | Medium         |
| MobX                 | OOP style, reactive            | ~15 kB | Medium         |
