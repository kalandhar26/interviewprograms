# LiftingStateUp

- Imagine two brothers sharing one TV remote 📺. If each brother has his own remote, they’ll keep fighting because the TV
  won’t know which one to listen to.
- So their parent keeps the remote and gives instructions to both kids.
- In React: The state (remote) is moved to the parent, Children ask the parent to change it
- This is called Lifting State Up.

## Professional Definition

- Lifting State Up is a React pattern where shared state is moved to the closest common parent component so that
  multiple child components can read and update the same state consistently via props and callbacks.
- Lifting state up means moving shared state to the nearest common parent so child components stay synchronized.

## Why Do We Need It?

- To share data between siblings
- To keep single source of truth
- To avoid duplicate or inconsistent state

## Problem Without Lifting State

```jsx
function ChildA() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
}

function ChildB() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
}
```

- ChildA and ChildB have separate states
- They can’t stay in sync

## Lift State Up to Parent

### Parent Component

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <ChildA count={count} onIncrement={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <ChildB count={count} />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Child Components

```jsx
function ChildA({ count, onIncrement }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onIncrement}>
      Increment: {count}
    </button>
  );
}

function ChildB({ count }) {
  return <h2>Count is {count}</h2>;
}
```

## Data Flow Diagram

```scss
ChildA → Parent (setState)
Parent → ChildA & ChildB (props)
```
