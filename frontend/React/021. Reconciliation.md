# Reconciliation

- Imagine you have a drawing book 📘. You draw a house 🏠 on page 1
- Later, you only change the door color 🚪.You don’t erase the whole page and redraw everything, right?
- You just erase the door and color it again 🎨. React works the same way.
- When state or props change. React does not rebuild the entire UI
- It compares old drawing with new drawing. Updates only what changed
- This smart comparison and updating process is called Reconciliation

- Reconciliation is the process by which React compares the previous Virtual DOM tree with the new Virtual DOM tree
  after a state or props change, determines the minimal set of changes, and efficiently updates the real DOM.
- **React uses:**
- Virtual DOM
- Diffing algorithm
- Reconciliation process

- **Result:**
  ✅ Faster UI updates
  ✅ Better performance
  ✅ Minimal DOM manipulation

## How Reconciliation Works (Step-by-Step)

- State / props change
- React creates a new Virtual DOM tree
- React compares it with the previous Virtual DOM
- Finds differences (diffing)
- Updates only changed DOM nodes
