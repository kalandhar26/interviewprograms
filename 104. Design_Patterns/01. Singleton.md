## Singleton Pattern

- The Singleton Pattern is a way to make sure a class has only one instance in your entire program, and you can access
  that instance from anywhere. Think of it like having a single, shared resource everyone uses, such as a company’s main
  printer. No matter who needs to print, they all use the same printer.
- Solves the problem of shared, expensive, or stateful resources (DB connection, config, logging).
- It’s useful when you want to control access to a resource that’s expensive to create (like a database connection) or
  when you need to ensure consistent behavior across your app (like a configuration settings manager). The Singleton
  Pattern prevents multiple instances from being created and provides one global point to access that single instance.

## PseudoCode Singleton

- Lazy initialization
```text
class Singleton
    private static instance = null   // holds the single object

    private constructor()            // private so no one can call "new"

    public static getInstance()
        if instance is null
            lock the class             // optional, for multi-thread safety and double checking.
                if instance is still null
                    instance = new Singleton()
        return instance
```

- Eager Initialization

```text
class Singleton
    private static instance = new Singleton()   // holds the single object

    private constructor()            // private so no one can call "new"

    public static getInstance()
        return instance             // Thread safe by default (always returns the same object)

```
```java
final class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton INSTANCE;

    private Singleton() {
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (INSTANCE == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (INSTANCE == null) INSTANCE = new Singleton();
            }
        }
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}

class SingletonDemo {
    static void run() {
        Singleton s1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton s2 = Singleton.getInstance();
        System.out.println("Singleton same? " + (s1 == s2));
    }
}
```
