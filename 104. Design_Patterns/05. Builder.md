## Builder Pattern

**What it does:** Constructs complex objects step by step (like customizing a computer).
**Real-life example:** Ordering a burger with specific toppings (bun, patty, cheese, etc.).
**defination** The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step-by-step.
It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.
Itâ€™s a creational pattern that increases readability, flexibility, and maintainability of object construction especially
when an object has many optional fields.

- Construct complex immutable objects step-by-step, separating construction from representation. Eliminates telescoping
  constructors.

## PseudoCode (Builder)
```text
1. create a class with many fields.
2. Make the constructor private.
3. Create a nested Builder class with the same fields.
4. In the Builder, create methods to set each field (returning this for chaining).
5. provide a build() method in builder to return the final object (original class object).
6. client code uses the builder to create objects in a readable way.

```java
final class House {
    private final int rooms;
    private final boolean garage;
    private final String material;

    private House(Builder b) {
        this.rooms = b.rooms;
        this.garage = b.garage;
        this.material = b.material;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private int rooms = 0;
        private boolean garage = false;
        private String material = "wood";

        public Builder rooms(int r) {
            this.rooms = r;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder garage(boolean g) {
            this.garage = g;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder material(String m) {
            this.material = m;
            return this;
        }

        public House build() {
            return new House(this);
        }
    }
}

class BuilderDemo {
    static void run() {
        House h = new House.Builder()
                .rooms(4)
                .garage(true)
                .material("concrete")
                .build();
        System.out.println("House built: " + h);
    }
}
