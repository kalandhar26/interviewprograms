## Adapter Pattern

**What it does:** Lets incompatible interfaces work together (like a USB-C to HDMI adapter).
**Real-life example:** A power plug adapter that lets you charge a foreign device.
**definition** The Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
It allows two unrelated classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by
the clients.

It falls under structural design patterns because it is concerned with class and object composition.

- Convert the interface of an existing class into another interface clients expect. Allows classes to work together that
  otherwise couldnâ€™t.

## PseudoCode
```text
1. Create a Target interface (the interface that client excepts)
2. Have an existing class (Adaptee) with a different/incompatible method.
3. Create an adapter class that implements target interface and internally call the Adaptee method.
4. Client code uses the target interface, but the adapter translates the call to the Adaptee. 
```
```java
// Target interface
interface BasicMediaPlayer {
    void play(String filename);
}
// Target interface
interface AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    void playVlc(String f);
    void playMp4(String f);
}

// Adaptee class
class VlcPlayer implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public void playVlc(String f) {
        System.out.println("Playing vlc " + f);
    }

    public void playMp4(String f) {
        System.out.println("Playing Mp4 " + f);
    }
}


// Adapter class
class MediaAdapter implements BasicMediaPlayer {
    private final AdvancedMediaPlayer adv = new VlcPlayer();

    public void play(String filename) {
        if (filename.endsWith(".vlc")) 
            adv.playVlc(filename);
    }
}

// Client code
class AdapterDemo {
    static void run() {
        BasicMediaPlayer player = new MediaAdapter();
        player.play("movie.vlc");
    }
}
```
