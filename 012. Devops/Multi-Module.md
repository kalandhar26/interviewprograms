- This repository structure supports a microservices architecture on AWS EKS, integrating Maven for builds, Docker for
  containerization, Helm and Kustomize for Kubernetes manifests, and ArgoCD for GitOps.
- **Services/** contains source code and CI/CD configurations for microservices (e.g., user-service, payment-service),
  built with Spring Boot and Maven.
- **Helm-charts/** and **k8s-manifests/** provide two approaches (Helm and Kustomize) for managing Kubernetes
  deployments, with **umbrella-chart/** simplifying multi-service deployments.
- **Infrastructure/** automates cloud resource provisioning (Terraform) and server configuration (Ansible), ensuring
  consistent EKS, RDS, and VPC setups.
- **Docs/** centralizes API, deployment, and architecture documentation, enhancing developer onboarding and system
  understanding.
- **Scripts/** automates repetitive tasks (build, deploy, setup, monitoring), improving operational efficiency.
- **Config/** manages configurations for monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), CI/CD (Jenkins), and GitOps (ArgoCD),
  ensuring observability and automation.
- **Docker-compose/** supports local development, enabling developers to run services and monitoring tools locally
  before deploying to EKS.
- **.github/** provides GitHub Actions workflows as an alternative CI/CD option, complementing or replacing Jenkins.
- For specific file examples (e.g., `main.tf`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `user-service.yaml`), detailed artifacts can be
  provided upon request, similar to prior responses.
